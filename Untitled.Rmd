title: "A2S exploratory analysis"
output: html_notebook
author: Renato Russo

This is a document with ongoing analysis of 

```{r}
"{\"component_type\":\"video\",
\"component_data\":
  {
  \"action\":\"play\",
  \"video\":\"https://admin.a2s.fablevision-dev.com/assets/videos/u1_hot_water_default.mp4\",
  \"video_time\":\"0:00\"
    }
}"

```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
