Abstract = {{To nuance current understandings of the proliferation of digital
   disinformation, this article seeks to develop an approach that
   emphasizes the imaginative dimension of this communication phenomenon.
   Anchored on ideas about the sociality of communication, this piece
   conceptualizes how fake news and political trolling online work in
   relation to particular shared understandings people have of their
   socio-political landscape. It offers the possibility of expanding the
   information-oriented approach to communication taken by many
   journalistic interventions against digital disinformation. It
   particularly opens up alternatives to the problematic strategy of
   challenging social media manipulation solely by doubling down on
   objectivity and facts.}},

Abstract = {{Although the need to understand the mechanisms of disinformation
   correction has been recognized, research on the effects of different
   forms of correcting messages is still scarce. Based on assumptions of
   the continued influence effect, we tested in a 2 (detailed versus simple
   correction) x 2 (immediate versus belated correction) between-subjects
   experimental study (N = 221) whether more detailed corrections are more
   effective in reducing misperceptions than simple corrections and whether
   they are particularly influential when presented belatedly. Results
   demonstrate that detailed corrections indeed lead to higher recall of
   correct facts but do not reduce concerns regarding the topic of the
   disinformation. When more detailed corrections are presented immediately
   together with the disinformation, they even seem to be counterproductive
   as they foster personal beliefs that are related to the disinformation.
   Regarding factual knowledge, the effect is reversed: When presented
   immediately with the disinformation, detailed corrections lead to a
   higher recall of correct facts than simple corrections. This suggests
   that we need to combat the influence of disinformation on factual
   knowledge and on personal beliefs in different ways.}},

Abstract = {{We study the problem of disinformation. We assume that an ``agent{''}
   has some sensitive information that the ``adversary{''} is trying to
   obtain. For example, a camera company (the agent) may secretly be
   developing its new camera model, and a user (the adversary) may want to
   know in advance the detailed specs of the model. The agent's goal is to
   disseminate false information to ``dilute{''} what is known by the
   adversary. We model the adversary as an Entity Resolution (ER) process
   that pieces together available information. We formalize the problem of
   finding the disinformation with the highest benefit given a limited
   budget for creating the disinformation and propose efficient algorithms
   for solving the problem. We then evaluate our disinformation planning
   algorithms on real and synthetic data and compare the robustness of
   existing ER algorithms. In general, our disinformation techniques can be
   used as a framework for testing ER robustness.}},

Abstract = {{The contemporary notion of disinformation bears some resemblance to the
   Augustinian concept of lying, as it carries with it the intention to
   deceive. Today, as in the past, several forms of deliberate deception
   reinforce illusions and prejudices, given that human cognition is
   deceptive. The novelty is the social impact resulting from the immense
   capacity for capturing, processing and circulating data of current
   sociotechnical mediations of information, which operate on the big data
   scale and whose reach, speed and capillarity make digital network
   disinformation an unprecedented and alarming phenomenon. The promotion
   of critical information literacy, which involves the maturation of
   critical sense, appears as a crucial means to mitigate the problem.}},

Abstract = {{This paper(2) provides an overview of current responses to fake news and
   digital disinformation inside and outside the EU, and assesses the
   advantages and disadvantages of each solution. Four approaches emerge:
   (1) self-regulation (i.e. actions undertaken on a voluntary basis by the
   digital platforms); (2) co-regulation (i.e. cooperation framework
   between EU-level and national-level authorities, the internet platform
   companies, media organizations, researchers, and other stakeholders);
   (3) direct regulation (i.e. legal measures \& sanctions); and (4)
   audience-centred solutions (i.e. fact-checking and media literacy). We
   argue in favour of the co-regulation approach, while drawing attention
   to some current challenges in the response against disinformation.
   Furthermore, we need to go beyond the understanding of disinformation as
   an information/truth fraud, and draw additional measures to reflect the
   particular understanding of disinformation as a form of users'
   engagement fraud.}},

Abstract = {{Electoral disinformation campaigns intentionally deceive voters, thereby
   disrupting the notion of fair elections and challenging western
   democracies to craft new policies that safeguard their electoral
   integrity. Over-regulation of political speech, however, can imperil the
   political participation of the informed voter, who in turn engages and
   influences other voters. Such policies for regulating electoral
   disinformation must therefore balance the tension between curbing speech
   and encouraging voters to engage in political participation through the
   free flow of information. Canadian elections law offers a possible
   solution for jurisdictions seeking to effectively regulate
   disinformation without unduly stifling free expression through the
   principle of informational equality. We argue for an updated principle
   of digital information equality to address the harms of disinformation.
   By reinvigorating the principle of information equality and adapting it
   from a theoretical concept to a regulatory device, this article proposes
   a new method to regulate electoral disinformation while supporting an
   informed electorate, respecting democratic principles, and protecting
   electoral integrity. In so doing, the article identifies three harmful
   examples of electoral disinformation that warrant increased regulation
   and concludes with recommendations for other jurisdictions seeking to
   regulate disinformation in the electoral context.}},

Abstract = {{Concerns over disinformation have intensified in recent years.
   Policymakers, pundits, and observers worry that countries like Russia
   are spreading false narratives and disseminating rumours in order to
   shape international opinion and, by extension, government policies to
   their liking. Despite the importance of this topic, mainstream theories
   in International Relations offer contradictory guidance on how to think
   about disinformation. I argue that disinformation is ineffective in
   terms of changing the policies of a target as regards to its foreign
   policy alignments and armaments - that is, the balance of power. To be
   strategically effective, disinformation must somehow overcome three
   powerful obstacles: first, the fundamental uncertainty that
   international anarchy generates over any information broadcasted by
   adversaries; second, the pre-existing prejudices of foreign policy
   elites and ordinary citizens; and third, the countermeasures that are
   available even amid political polarisation. I examine the most likely
   case of there seemingly being a conscious and effective strategy that
   emphasises disinformation: the Russian campaign that has targeted the
   Baltic states, especially since the 2014 annexation of Crimea. The
   available evidence strongly suggests that the strategic effects of
   disinformation are exaggerated.}},

Abstract = {{This paper provides an assessment of the ability of different
   international relations theories to grasp modern uses of international
   digital disinformation. More specifically, the paper argues that E. H.
   Carr's notion of propaganda, John J. Mearsheimer's typology of lies and
   Joseph Nye's conceptualisation of public diplomacy all offer useful
   theoretical lenses through which we can advance our understanding of
   international digital disinformation. Their added value is demonstrated
   by applying these three theoretical perspectives to three `prototype
   cases' of modern international digital disinformation. The paper
   concludes that the three theoretical perspectives make new aspects of
   international digital disinformation intelligible, including the
   underlying motives for using digital disinformation. However, there
   still remains a space for a more detailed theoretical account of digital
   disinformation and its use in modern international relations.}},

Abstract = {{The study is a meta-analytical investigation. It starts from the thesis
   that disinformation is communication, represents a disinformative
   communication. The action of disinformation is a communicational
   operation. In disinformation, communication functions in an
   anti-informational mode. Disinformation constitutes the disinformative
   mode of communication. Jeff Wells observes that when is missing the
   truth, ``communication{''} is ``disinformative{''} (Wells, 2008).
   Disinformation is a problem of information ({''}use of false
   information{''} Fetzer, 2004; Gackowski, 2006; Stahl, 2006) and
   information is an informational type of communication. Thus,
   disinformation is a quest ion of communication, is a special type of
   communication. Anyway, disinformation is communication. When we talk
   about of an action of disinformation, we talk about a disinformative
   communication. The first specialist who speaks about ``disinformative
   communication{''} is Michael Smithson in 1989. We try to impose the idea
   of disinformative communication and the idea that disinformation is the
   standard form of disinformative communication.}},

Abstract = {{In public domain electronic information systems the need to provide
   effective mechanisms ensuring the authenticity of not only the data, but
   also of all the information system components becomes more and more
   imperative. This paper presents the results of research on protecting
   information systems against disinformation attacks. On the basis of
   information theory and set theory information systems are compared with
   disinformation systems. Methods of creating autonomous disinformation
   systems and disinformation systems based on the existing information
   systems are described. Special attention is given to mechanisms by which
   pseudorandom disinformation systems are constructed. Since it is very
   difficult to locate such system, they constitute effective means of
   propagating untrue and incomplete knowledge.
   To describe the disinformation properties of systems, a measure of
   disinformation in the form of distortion coefficient a is introduced. It
   is shown how disinformation systems evolving in time can be constructed.
   In disinformation propagation, the creation of disinformation systems
   based on the existing information systems plays a major role. Besides
   the large amounts of accumulated knowledge, the existing information
   systems have the users' confidence. As a result of a disinformation
   attack such systems can be transformed into disinformation systems. The
   insurance of the authenticity of the information contained in
   information systems is a major problem in running such systems.
   Simple cryptographic methods of ensuring authenticity, such as digital
   signatures and marks, are easy to implement but they do not fully
   protect the authenticity of information. In this paper, methods of
   ensuring the authenticity of information by embedding additional hidden
   information layers in images or other elements stored in the knowledge
   bases or the viewing layers of information systems are proposed. The
   proposed solutions are the latest results of the research undertaken by
   the author in 1997. In particular, a new kind of invisible structural
   signatures for the construction of invisible layers protecting the
   authenticity of information are proposed. Such signatures are more
   resistant to scanning and printing whereby the hidden authentication
   information can be transferred to documents printed in the information
   system.}},

   and Disinformation in the US and the Netherlands}},
Journal = {{POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{146-157}},
Abstract = {{The discursive construction of a populist divide between the `good'
   people and `corrupt' elites can conceptually be linked to
   disinformation. More specifically, (right-wing) populists are not only
   attributing blame to the political elites, but increasingly vent
   anti-media sentiments in which the mainstream press is scapegoated for
   not representing the people. In an era of post-truth relativism, `fake
   news' is increasingly politicized and used as a label to delegitimize
   political opponents or the press. To better understand the affinity
   between disinformation and populism, this article conceptualizes two
   relationships between these concepts: (1) blame attributions to the
   dishonest media as part of the corrupt elites that mislead the people;
   and (2) the expression of populist boundaries in a people-centric,
   anti-expert, and evidence-free way. The results of a comparative
   qualitative content analysis in the US and Netherlands indicate that the
   political leaders Donald Trump and Geert Wilders blame legacy media in
   populist ways by regarding them as part of the corrupt and lying
   establishment. Compared to left-wing populist and mainstream
   politicians, these politicians are the most central players in the
   discursive construction of populist disinformation. Both politicians
   bypassed empirical evidence and expert knowledge whilst prioritizing the
   people's truth and common sense at the center stage of honesty and
   reality. These expressions resonated with public opinion on Facebook,
   although citizens were more likely to frame mis- and disinformation in
   terms of ideological cleavages. These findings have important
   implications for our understanding of the role of populist discourse in
   a post-factual era.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - With the outset of automatic detection of information,
   misinformation, and disinformation, the purpose of this paper is to
   examine and discuss various conceptions of information, misinformation,
   and disinformation within philosophy of information.
   Design/methodology/approach - The examinations are conducted within a
   Gricean framework in order to account for the communicative aspects of
   information, misinformation, and disinformation as well as the detection
   enterprise.
   Findings - While there often is an exclusive focus on truth and falsity
   as that which distinguish information from misinformation and
   disinformation, this paper finds that the distinguishing features are
   actually intention/intentionality and non-misleadingness/misleadingness
   - with non-misleadingness/misleadingness as the primary feature.
   Further, the paper rehearses the argument in favor of a true variety of
   disinformation and extends this argument to include true misinformation.
   Originality/value - The findings are novel and pose a challenge to the
   possibility of automatic detection of misinformation and disinformation.
   Especially the notions of true disinformation and true misinformation,
   as varieties of disinformation and misinformation, which force the
   true/false dichotomy for information vs mis-/disinformation to collapse.}},

Abstract = {{Disinformation or ``fake news{''} has continuously proven to be a
   pervasive threat in the digital space. The spread and persistence of
   disinformation especially in the social networking media sites currently
   factors as one of the most challenging threat for users and content
   administrators alike. Its ecosystem encompasses several attributing
   factors including but not limited to humans as information users and
   source, social communication model as its channel, current trust models
   in place as defense and guards against it, and finally the archival
   correction that may halt its persistence in the social space. In this
   paper, the author aims to explore the dynamics of the several
   interacting fields i.e. Psychology and Computer Science, their influence
   on its phenomenon, which provides an ideal interdisciplinary and
   holistic approach to its reduction and management. Another equally
   important section in this paper is its attempt to advocate to formally
   recognize disinformation as a cybersecurity threat for its prospective
   future categorization. The possible application of discourse analysis as
   a potential technological tool for its detection as solution is also
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{In the Web 2.0 age, mass media disseminates the disinformation of

   the core disseminators in the dissemination process. We propose the
   concept of a disinformation channel and quantitatively analyse these
   company-related disinformation channels among media outlets. By
   empirically analysing 4,689 disinformation news values and 330 channels
   in 2018, we reveal that the disinformation values and negative news
   values are characteristics. We also build automatic identification
   models to identify these channels from the media combined with machine
   learning algorithms. Our study sheds light on disinformation, thus
   providing managers with an empirical basis upon which to analyse the

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{It is frequently claimed that online disinformation threatens democracy,
   and that disinformation is more prevalent or harmful because social
   media platforms have disrupted our communication systems. These
   intuitions have not been fully developed in democratic theory. This
   article builds on systemic approaches to deliberative democracy to
   characterize key vulnerabilities of social media platforms that
   disinformation actors exploit, and to clarify potential
   anti-deliberative effects of disinformation. The disinformation
   campaigns mounted by Russian agents around the United States' 2016
   election illustrate the use of anti-deliberative tactics,
   includingcorrosive falsehoods, moral denigration, andunjustified
   inclusion. We further propose that these tactics might contribute to the
   system-level anti-deliberative properties ofepistemic cynicism,
   techno-affective polarization, andpervasive inauthenticity. These harms
   undermine a polity's capacity to engage in communication characterized
   by the use of facts and logic, moral respect, and democratic inclusion.
   Clarifying which democratic goods are at risk from disinformation, and
   how they are put at risk, can help identify policies that go beyond
   targeting the architects of disinformation campaigns to address
   structural vulnerabilities in deliberative systems.}},

Abstract = {{Disinformation has become a formidable challenge to the integrity of
   electoral processes as well as the internal political stability of many
   countries. This state of affairs has spurred a wave of new regulatory
   measures in several countries. From stringent rules governing
   dissemination of political advertisements via social media platforms to
   media literacy programmes, the past few years saw the introduction of
   legislative and non-legislative measures in many jurisdictions. Ethiopia
   is no exception in introducing measures to address the problem. This
   article examines Ethiopia's policy responses towards addressing the
   impact of disinformation on the integrity and credibility of elections.
   It argues that measures taken thus far in Ethiopia appear to address the
   impact of disinformation on national security and social harmony. As
   such, Ethiopia has not taken tailored measures to address the impact of
   disinformation on its democratic aspirations, particularly in holding
   free, fair and democratic elections.}},

   The authors first present relevant concepts including hybrid threats and

   intersectionality as a method. Thereafter they discuss how
   disinformation is used to destabilise societies by directly attacking
   civilian spaces and attempting to foment polarisation and unrest, if not
   conflict. The authors then discuss how the concepts of disinformation
   and civilian agency are illuminated through gender and intersectional
   analyses, speaking to complex, civilian contexts by examining how gender
   (and race) have been employed to attempt to foment destabilisation. They
   conclude with some brief reflections about the role of gender and
   intersectional approaches in understanding hybrid threats and warfare,
   not just in Europe but also for other parts of the world.}},

Title = {{First-Generation Immigrants' and Sojourners' Believability Evaluation of
   Disinformation}},
Journal = {{HOWARD JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATIONS}},
Abstract = {{News consumption enhances the contact experience for first-generation
   immigrants and sojourners in their acculturation to the host culture.
   Using acculturation theory, this study explores interdisciplinary
   concepts related to understanding immigrants' and sojourners'
   believability evaluation of disinformation. The authors conducted an
   online experiment to examine the believability of disinformation by
   asking immigrants and sojourners (N = 71) to discern online news stories
   without disinformation from online stories containing disinformation.
   The present study found that first-generation immigrants and sojourners
   with higher levels of perceived English language proficiency, longer
   length of stays in the U.S., and greater US news consumption are more
   likely to demonstrate higher news IQ, which leads to less believability
   of disinformation. Although news plays a critical role in understanding
   current events and issues pertinent to individuals' day-to-day lives,
   communities, societies, and governments, immigrants and sojourners are
   largely marginalized populations as news consumers. As foreign-born
   residents make up close to 14\% of the U.S. population, this study will
   provide meaningful insights.}},

Abstract = {{While the content of hostile disinformation narratives is relatively
   well-researched, how these narratives interact and are amplified to
   generate psychological effects requires further scrutiny. To address
   this gap, this study uses Russian COVID-19 disinformation combined with
   network methodologies to contextualize a novel hypothetical model of
   this process. Specifically, we conduct a content analysis of known
   disinformation articles about COVID-19 (N = 65) from Russian news
   sources (e.g. RT, Sputnik, New Eastern Outlook). Using co-occurrence
   network visualizations, we map the pathways from narrative to
   psychological effects to provide new insights and testable models of the
   effects of COVID-19 disinformation. Main findings show that hostile
   anti-Western narratives primarily target the emotions of anger, disgust,
   and confusion to undermine citizens' trust in (supra-) governmental
   institutions and the media. This is the first step in a research agenda
   that can help media practitioners develop interventions and aid policy
   makers bolster societal resilience to hostile disinformation campaigns.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRESS-POLITICS}},
Abstract = {{Can residents of Ukraine discern between pro-Kremlin disinformation and
   true statements? Moreover, which pro-Kremlin disinformation claims are
   more likely to be believed, and by which audiences? We present the
   results from two surveys carried out in 2019-one online and the other
   face-to-face-that address these questions in Ukraine, where the Russian
   government and its supporters have heavily targeted disinformation
   campaigns. We find that, on average, respondents can distinguish between
   true stories and disinformation. However, many Ukrainians remain
   uncertain about a variety of disinformation claims' truthfulness. We
   show that the topic of the disinformation claim matters. Disinformation
   about the economy is more likely to be believed than disinformation
   about politics, historical experience, or the military. Additionally,
   Ukrainians with partisan and ethnolinguistic ties to Russia are more
   likely to believe pro-Kremlin disinformation across topics. Our findings
   underscore the importance of evaluating multiple types of disinformation
   claims present in a country and examining these claims' target
   audiences.}},

Abstract = {{One of the principal difficulties in classifying and interpreting online
   disinformation is that the data arrive rapidly and evolve dramatically.
   The core challenges of classification and interpretation are not unique
   to contemporary disinformation; the problem of classifying documented
   information as authentic or inauthentic has been the focus of archivists
   for centuries. However, the rate of information creation and
   dissemination enabled by the Internet requires a new approach to
   categorization and archival examination of disinformation of documented
   information. This paper provides a survey of the archival problems
   facing disinformation researchers and proposes a taxonomy of
   disinformation that will aid future discussion and classification of
   disinformation.}},

Abstract = {{This introduction to the special issue considers how independent
   research on mis/disinformation campaigns can be conducted in a corporate
   environment hostile to academic research. We provide an overview of the
   disinformation landscape in the wake of the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica
   data scandal and social platforms' decision to enforce access lockdowns
   and the throttling of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) for data
   collection. We argue that the governance shift from user communities to
   social media algorithms, along with social platforms' intensive emphasis
   on generating revenue from user data, has eroded the mutual trust of
   networked publics and opened the way for dis/misinformation campaigns.
   We discuss the importance of open, public APIs for academic research as
   well as the unique challenges of collecting social media data to study
   highly ephemeral mis/disinformation campaigns. The introduction
   concludes with an assessment of the growing data access gap that not
   only hinders research of public interest, but that may also preclude
   researchers from identifying meaningful research questions as activity
   on social platforms becomes increasingly more inscrutable and
   unobservable.}},

Abstract = {{Online platforms providing information and media content follow certain
   goals and optimize for certain metrics when deploying automated decision
   making systems to recommend pieces of content from the vast amount of
   media items uploaded to or indexed by their platforms every day. These
   optimization metrics differ markedly from, for example, the so-called
   news factors journalists traditionally use tomake editorial decisions.
   Social networks, video platforms and search engines thus create content
   hierarchies that reflect not only user interest but also their own
   monetization goals. This sometimes has unintended, societally highly
   problematic effects: Optimizing for metrics like dwell time, watch time
   or ``engagement{''} can promote disinformation and propaganda content.

Abstract = {{Informed by social media data collected following four terror attacks in
   the UK in 2017, this article delineates a series of ``techniques of
   disinformation{''} used by different actors to try and influence how the
   events were publicly defined and understood. By studying the causes and
   consequences of misleading information following terror attacks, the
   article contributes empirically to the neglected topic of social
   reactions to terrorism. It also advances scholarship on the workings of
   disinforming communications, by focusing on a domain other than
   political elections, which has been the empirical focus for most studies
   of disinformation to date. Theoretically, the analysis is framed by
   drawing an analogy with Gresham Sykes and David Matza's (1957) account
   of the role of ``techniques of neutralization{''} originally published
   in the American Sociological Review. The connection being that where
   they studied deviant behaviour, a similar analytic lens can usefully be
   applied to disinformation cast as ``deviant{''} information.}},

Abstract = {{Despite concerns about the effects of pro-Russian disinformation on
   Western public opinion, evidence of its reach remains scarce. We
   hypothesize that conservative individuals will be more likely than
   liberals to be potentially exposed to pro-Russian disinformation in

   U.S.-based Twitter users, testing how ideology is associated with
   disinformation about the 2014 crash of the MH17 aircraft over eastern
   Ukraine. We find that potential exposure to disinformation is
   concentrated among the most conservative individuals. Moving from the
   most liberal to the most conservative individuals in the sample is
   associated with a change in the conditional probability of potential
   exposure to disinformation from 6.5\% to 45.2\%. We corroborate the
   finding using a second, validated data set on individual party
   registration. The results indicate that the reach of online, pro-Russian
   disinformation into U.S. audiences is distinctly ideologically
   asymmetric.}},

Abstract = {{The growth of online Digital/social media has allowed a variety of ideas
   and opinions to coexist. Social Media has appealed users due to the ease
   of fast dissemination of information at low cost and easy access.
   However, due to the growth in affordance of Digital platforms, users
   have become prone to consume disinformation, misinformation, propaganda,
   and conspiracy theories. In this paper, we wish to explore the links
   between the personality traits given by the Big Five Inventory and their
   susceptibility to disinformation. More specifically, this study is
   attributed to capture the short-term as well as the long-term effects of
   disinformation and its effects on the five personality traits. Further,
   we expect to observe that different personalities traits have different
   shifts in opinion and different increase or decrease of uncertainty on
   an issue after consuming the disinformation. Based on the findings of
   this study, we would like to propose a personalized narrative-based
   change in behavior for different personality traits.}},

Abstract = {{Medical disinformation has interfered with healthcare workers' ability
   to communicate with the general population in a wide variety of public
   health contexts globally. This has limited the effectiveness of
   evidence-based medicine and healthcare capacity. Disinformation
   campaigns often try to integrate or co-opt healthcare workers in their
   practices which hinders effective health communication. We describe a
   critical overview of issues health practitioners and communicators have
   experienced when dealing with medical disinformation online and offline
   as well as best practices to overcome these issues when disseminating
   health information. This article lists disinformation techniques that
   have yet to be used against the medical community but need to be
   considered in future communication planning as they may be highly
   effective. We also present broad policy recommendations and
   considerations designed to mitigate the effectiveness of medical
   disinformation campaigns.}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Online disinformation has been on the rise in recent years. A digital
   outbreak of disinformation has spread around the COVID-19 pandemic,
   often referred to as an ``infodemic.{''} Since January 2020, digital
   media have been both the culprits of and antidotes to misinformation.
   The first months of the pandemic have shown that countering
   disinformation online has become as important as ensuring much needed
   medical equipment and supplies for health workers. For many governments
   around the world, priority COVID-19 actions included measures such as
   (a) providing guidance to social media companies on taking down
   contentious pandemic content (e.g., India); (b) establishing special
   units to combat disinformation (e.g., EU, UK); and (c) criminalizing
   malicious coronavirus falsehood, including in relation to public health
   measures. This article explores the short and potential long-term
   effects of newly passed legislation in various countries directly
   targeting COVID-19 disinformation on the media, whether traditional or
   digital. The early actions enacted under the state-of-emergency carve
   new directions in negotiating the delicate balance between freedom of
   expression and online censorship, in particular by imposing limitations
   on access to information and inducing self-restraint in reporting. Based
   on comparative legal analysis, this article provides a timely discussion
   of intended and unintended consequences of such legal responses to the
   ``infodemic,{''} reflecting on a basic set of safeguards needed to
   preserve trust in online information.}},

Abstract = {{Social networks have surpassed their intermediary role and become
   gatekeepers of online content and traffic. This transformation has
   favored the spread of information disorders. The situation is especially
   alarming in Spain, where 57\% of Spaniards have at some moment believed
   false news. Since 2016, First Draft has promoted several collaborative
   verification projects that brought together newsrooms to fact-check
   false, misleading and confusing claims circulating online during
   presidential elections in several countries. The main objective of this
   article is to study the collaboration forged between newsrooms in Spain
   in order to debunk disinformation contents in 2019 under the name of
   Comprobado (Verified) and the impact of this initiative. Applying a
   methodological approach based on non-participant observation,
   interviews, content analysis of reports, scientific articles, books and
   media archives, we examine the internal uses of this platform, how
   journalists verified public discourse, the strategies and internal
   agreements implemented, and the degree of participation of the 16 media
   involved. Results show that only half of the initiatives begun were
   transformed into published reports, and the media impact achieved was
   limited. Finally, we note that the principal reasons for the frustration
   of the project were its improvised implementation, due to the date of
   the election being brought forward, and the scant culture of
   collaboration in the sector. In Spain at least, cross-media alliances
   are still an exception.}},

Abstract = {{The distinction between misinformation and disinformation becomes
   especially important in political, editorial, and advertising contexts,
   where sources may make deliberate efforts to mislead, deceive, or
   confuse an audience in order to promote their personal, religious, or
   ideological objectives. The difference consists in having an agenda. It
   thus bears comparison with lying, because ``lies{''} are assertions that
   are false, that are known to be false, and that are asserted with the
   intention to mislead, deceive, or confuse. One context in which
   disinformation abounds is the study of the death of JFK, which I know
   from more than a decade of personal research experience. Here I reflect
   on that experience and advance a preliminary ``theory of
   disinformation{''} that is intended to stimulate thinking on this
   increasingly important subject. Five kinds of disinformation are
   distinguished and exemplified by real life cases I have encountered. It
   follows that the story you are about to read true.}},

Journal = {{JOURNALISM PRACTICE}},
Abstract = {{Social media have led to profound transformations in the media ecosystem
   and new communication dynamics. Such platforms have become a competitive
   source of information and played a decisive role in facilitating the
   dissemination of false or misleading content, with a particular impact
   on recent elections. This study analyses the formats and the spread of
   disinformation during Brazil's 2018 election on social media,
   considering the countermeasures adopted that year by the platforms to
   reduce its circulation. Disinformation occupies a central space in the
   public debate in Brazil, where there is massive use of social media.
   Based on a content analysis of the 153 false or misleading narratives
   most shared during the campaign period, the results show that contents
   changed formats to overcome platforms' countermeasures. Results also
   highlight a majority of images and a blend of false and accurate
   information that reshape the phenomenon definition and suggests the
   inefficacy of current regulations.}},

Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{47}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{In 2020, Twitter launched a new strategy dubbed `prebunking' in hopes of
   pre-emptively countering false information about voting by mail and
   election results. Prebunking was touted as a potential solution;
   however, little empirical research has tested the strategy to examine
   its effectiveness towards disinformation in the realm of public
   relations. Exploring PR-based disinformation attacks as a paracrisis,
   the purpose of this online quasiexperimental design study (N = 965) was
   to investigate the effects of an attack and how prebunking strategies,
   grounded in inoculation theory, can protect organizational outcomes
   (i.e., reputation and credibility) by interweaving positive psychology.
   In addition to examining effects on attitudinal components, this study
   also inspected dimensions of social amplification to determine if
   prebunking messages can thwart the spread of disinformation via
   Facebook. Findings provide insight into advancing the conceptual
   framework of proactive disinformation responses for crisis communication
   by demonstrating the success of using prebunking with autonomy support
   and explicit details to thwart adverse effects of disinformation.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose This paper seeks to disambiguate the phenomenon by clarifying
   terms, highlighting current efforts, including the importance of
   critical thought and awareness, and a test for genuine serendipity.
   Design/methodology/approach The authors review the literature, primarily
   from a library and information science perspective, and arrive at a
   theoretical framework and model. Findings The authors find various
   initiatives to fight fake news. Building upon Karlova and Fisher's
   (2013) model as well as research on critical thinking and serendipity,
   the primary contribution of the paper is a disinformation behavior
   framework and model. The model includes both the problem of
   disinformation from a creator and user perspective, as well as the
   solutions to fight it. Research limitations/implications The framework
   will guide practitioners and researchers in library and information
   science and beyond, as well as other stakeholders in both understanding
   the phenomenon, and leading the fight against it. Originality/value The
   spreading of false information has become an alarming phenomenon in the
   last few years, leading to the popularity of terms such as
   misinformation, disinformation, infodemic and fake news. While
   information professionals have been called upon to lead the fight
   against fake news, in the lack of a comprehensive understanding of the
   phenomenon, current efforts have been isolated and inadequate. Most
   models of information behavior deal with information, and not

Abstract = {{Disinformation spread on social networking platforms poses a major
   threat to national security. The present study is an attempt to
   investigate the challenge of disinformation and fake news in social
   media and their impact on security. To provide context for this
   challenge, the paper focuses on answering the following research
   questions: (1) what is the reach of disinformation in social media? (2)
   how is disinformation spread in social media? (3) what strategies do
   social bots employ in order to spread disinformation? In order to meet
   the objectives of the study and answer the research questions, a
   thorough literature review has been carried out with mixed research
   techniques. The findings of the study show that a great deal of
   disinformation is distributed by social bots that attack, hijack and
   manipulate discourse in social media. The use of social bots for
   disseminating disinformation brings substantial damage: they can exert a
   direct impact on the election results and therefore pose a serious
   threat to democracy. Furthermore, bots promote certain values, mislead
   and polarise public opinion and have a far-reaching political and
   economic impact. The analysis of disinformation dissemination strategies
   allows us to understand the problem, tackle it and deter more
   effectively.}},

Abstract = {{The rise of digital media contributes to fake news and disinformation
   being circulated on a larger scale and pace. The central aim of the work
   is to consider the potentials of individuals to actively respond to
   disinformation and fake news. In that regard, the authors rely on
   Archer's theoretical framework of reflexivity and its modes, It is
   argued that a specific mode of reflexivity, namely meta-reflexivity, can
   enable people to take a critical distance towards media messaging. The
   method involves the Reflexivity Measurement Tool (RMT) to provide an
   approximate assessment of one's reflexivity in terms of quantitative
   scores, The survey has been conducted in Slovenia on a representative
   national sample and path analysis is applied to identify the
   relationship between demographic features, media exposure, reflexivity
   and fact-checking. The results show how age and education affect media
   preferences, in terms of how frequently an individual is exposed to a
   particular type of media, Younger people, women and persons with
   tertiary education are more meta-reflexive, which contributes to their
   active response to disinformation. It is concluded that meta-reflexivity
   is essential but not sufficient to produce an active response of
   individuals to disinformation. Need for professional
   fact-checking-services and media education is discussed.}},

   the number of deaths from coronavirus due to the proliferation of hoaxes

Abstract = {{How should an organized response to disinformation proceed in a 21st
   century democratic society? At the highest level, what strategies are
   available? This paper attempts to answer these questions by looking at
   what three contemporary counter disinformation organizations are
   actually doing, then analyzing their tactics. The EU East StratCom Task
   Force is a contemporary government counter-propaganda agency. Facebook
   has made numerous changes to its operations to try to combat
   disinformation, and is a good example of what platforms can do. The
   Chinese information regime is a marvel of networked information control,
   and provokes questions about what a democracy should and should not do.
   The tactics used by these organizations can be grouped into six high
   level strategies: refutation, exposure of inauthenticity, alternative
   narratives, algorithmic filter manipulation, speech laws, and
   censorship. I discuss the effectiveness and political legitimacy of
   these approaches when used within a democracy with an open Internet and
   a free press.}},

Abstract = {{The epidemic of political disinformation in social media has in part
   triggered the transition to the post-truth era in which emotional and
   ideological appeals are more influential in shaping public opinion than
   objective facts. In this study we examined the cognitive and affective
   responses that political disinformation prompted in Facebook, as the
   most popular social media platform. Through text analysis of user
   comments corpora on nearly 2,100 political posts from popular sources in
   Facebook, we found that compared to true news, political disinformation
   received significantly less analytic responses from Facebook followers.
   While the results indicated greater anxiety in responses to true news,
   responses to political disinformation were filled with greater anger and
   incivility. We also found similar (low) levels of cognitive thinking in
   responses to extreme conservative and extreme liberal disinformation.
   Contrary to prior research findings, our results indicated that
   responses to extreme liberal disinformation in Facebook were filled with
   greater anger and incivility. This suggests that the incivility and
   outrage in online political discourses should not be attributed to a
   specific political party without considering the concurrent political
   events.}},

Abstract = {{The COVID-19 pandemic has been an event which has adversely affected
   people throughout the world. It has been asserted that in the United
   States, the extent of the devastation and disruption of life has been
   exacerbated by the response of the federal government, which was
   personified by former President Donald J. Trump. He was a leader whose
   unprecedented number of distortions, misleading statements, and frank
   lies resulted in a great erosion of trust in a time of great peril.
   Significantly, this propaganda was apparently believed by almost half of
   the electorate, as evidenced by the results of the 2020 election, where
   he lost to Joe Biden in a close race. As a result, there has been an
   intensification of a traumatically induced regression in the United
   States, characterized by increased divisiveness, dysfunction, and
   violence. This paper will psychoanalytically explore the author's
   contention that there has been a dual pandemic which has damaged the

Abstract = {{Many democratic nations are experiencing increased levels of false
   information circulating through social media and political websites that
   mimic journalism formats. In many cases, this disinformation is
   associated with the efforts of movements and parties on the radical
   right to mobilize supporters against centre parties and the mainstream
   press that carries their messages. The spread of disinformation can be
   traced to growing legitimacy problems in many democracies. Declining
   citizen confidence in institutions undermines the credibility of
   official information in the news and opens publics to alternative
   information sources. Those sources are often associated with both
   nationalist (primarily radical right) and foreign (commonly Russian)
   strategies to undermine institutional legitimacy and destabilize centre
   parties, governments and elections. The Brexit campaign in the United
   Kingdom and the election of Donald Trump in the United States are among
   the most prominent examples of disinformation campaigns intended to
   disrupt normal democratic order, but many other nations display signs of
   disinformation and democratic disruption. The origins of these problems
   and their implications for political communication research are

Abstract = {{Land and sea were the original warfighting domains; at the turn of the
   20th-century air was recognized, and roughly fifty years later, space
   became the fourth warfighting domain. Humanity is in the Information
   Age, and cyberspace is recognized as the fifth warfighting domain. Much
   debate surrounds this distinction. The complete lack of doctrine
   specifying what is required to be a domain serves to exacerbate an
   already contentious topic further. Many have proffered suggestions on
   what these requirements ought to be. For example, the literature
   suggests six requirements for a warfare domain, but a more accurate
   description of what was presented is six characteristics. If one of the
   six requirements were removed, any of the four physical domains would
   still exist as a domain. The notion of the warfare domain changed with
   the doctrinal codification of cyberspace. Previously, the warfare
   domains-land, sea, air, and space- were exclusively physical; the advent
   of cyberspace represents the first man-made warfare domain. While the
   physical, information and cognitive dimensions are accounted for in the
   doctrine associated with the physical domains, the same cannot be said
   for cyberspace. Representation of the three dimensions renders the means
   and ways of attacking and defending readily discernable. There are
   unique challenges related to cyberspace such as attribution, cyber
   personas, and cascading effects that make determining appropriate
   retaliation complex. In this context, the most prominent and difficult
   to defend threat vector is disinformation. In this paper, we discuss
   disinformation from the warfighting domain perspective. We offer a new
   conceptualization of cyberspace as a warfare domain. In doing so, the
   paper proposes recognition of the cognitive dimension in cyberspace as a
   solution to the problems associated with the fundamental problem in the
   complex information ecosystem, disinformation.}},

Abstract = {{Disinformation, also as known as fake news, is overwhelming.
   Intentionally false information is widespread. However, the detection of
   fake news is remaining to be a challenge due to the nature of the
   complexity of languages. Linear regression algorithms are proven to be
   effective in many practices. In this paper, the Passive-Aggressive and
   the Multinomial Naive Bayes are studied for fake news detection that
   involves term frequency and inverse document frequency to vectorize news
   content. Our results show that the Passive-Aggressive is more efficient
   than Multinomial Naive Bayes by combing with term frequency and inverse
   document frequency and could be applied as a primary screen for complex
   disinformation detection practically.}},

Abstract = {{We live in a hyper-informed society that is constantly being fed with
   information stimuli. That information may not be correct, and society
   may be vulnerable to it. We present a methodological proposal with a
   mixed approach that allows the learning of the characteristics and
   weaknesses of news consumers in the face of disinformation. Said
   methodology moves away from the traditional model, and with it a new,
   much more complete and complex way of conducting discussion groups is
   carried out. The qualitative approach is carried out through the
   creation of an online community in which subjects are encouraged to
   participate in different activities and tests. On the other hand, in
   order to obtain quantitative data, a quasi-experimental survey where
   respondents are exposed to various stimuli created ad hoc, which seeks
   to measure the interest and credibility of different news items through
   an orthogonal design, is carried out. The use of this methodology will
   allow for an expansive and intensive approach to the knowledge of
   societal vulnerability factors, and with the subsequent results, a solid
   basis of disinformation can be established, which will allow for the
   development of a series of strategies to combat disinformation.}},

Abstract = {{The article presents the results of an experimental study of
   psychological errors which occur when a person performing identification
   has been told false identification features before the actual procedure.
   We have revealed the mechanisms of disinformation effect: the
   generalization of working memory representations and involuntary mental
   information adding. Previous studies of the phenomenon of misinformation
   focused on the study of unintentional memorization, in the process of
   which the mechanism of an external implanted facility (misinformation)
   was introduced. In the experiments of other scientists, it was not
   possible to preset memorizing the elements of the event or the
   appearance of the subjects. It is shown that a preliminary instruction
   to memorize the features of an object does not reduce the disinformation
   effect. At the same time, a prior memorizing instruction can block the
   influence of gender, age and professional attitudes, but it does not
   block the subjective attitudes of a particular person. It was shown that
   reproducing facts some time later is not the main cause of
   identification errors.}},

Abstract = {{A conflict may develop when people ascribe different meanings to shared
   phenomena that entail action. In simple situations, resolution can be by
   persuading the other actors so that actions converge. In complex
   situations, explicit persuasion attempts are all too often ineffective.
   Effective persuasion might entail subtly attempting to alter the
   ascribed meaning of words and concepts. In modern warfare, adversaries
   can attempt to exploit the quirks of human psychology to influence,
   usurp, and manipulate everyday decisions by using disinformation. We
   introduce a conceptual model of information operations, drawing on the
   paradigm of implicit learning with Artificial Grammar Learning (AGL).
   The structure, grammar, and patterns of a Twitter data sample are
   examined. The modeling approach for designing, understanding, and
   formalizing the complex competitions of the information era is
   discussed, as is the possibility of using the model for reverse
   engineering as a possible disinformation stream. An argument is made for
   an alternative model for negating the effects of disinformation in the
   cognitive domain.}},

Title = {{The sharing of disinformation in cross-national comparison: analyzing
   patterns of resilience}},
Journal = {{INFORMATION COMMUNICATION \& SOCIETY}},
Abstract = {{Although the problem of disinformation is on the rise across the globe,
   previous research has found that countries differ in the extent of
   widespread disinformation. In this study, we examine the willingness to
   disseminate disinformation across six countries (Belgium, France,
   Germany, Switzerland, the U.K. and the U.S.). We use a model by
   Humprecht et al. (2020) to study to what degree various
   systemic-structural factors influence individual behavior and contribute
   to resilience to disinformation. We draw on uniformly collected primary
   survey data and use regression analyses to examine which factors may
   explain citizens' decisions to not further propagate disinformation. The
   results of our cross-national study show that resilience factors are
   country-specific and are highly dependent on the respective political
   and information environments. While in some countries extreme ideology
   weakens resilience, in others low education can have such an effect.
   Cross-national resilience factors include heavy social media use, the
   use of alternative media, and populist party support. We discuss what
   kind of tailored measures in combating online disinformation are needed
   to improve social resilience across different countries.}},

Title = {{Disinformation and gendered boundarymaking: Nordic media audiences
   making sense of ``Swedish decline{''}}},
Journal = {{COOPERATION AND CONFLICT}},
Abstract = {{This article examines how Russian geostrategic communication is
   entangled in global gender politics. The aim is to understand the
   resonance of disinformation in relation to culturalized, ethnicized and
   racialized narratives of gender, or ``gendered boundarymaking.{''} The
   analysis is based on focus group discussions with Swedish, Danish, and
   Norwegian individuals, asked to share their impressions of news articles
   from the Russian media agency Sputnik, which all depicted Sweden as a
   warning example of multiculturalism and feminism gone ``too far.{''} In
   the discussions, participants opposed a gender equal ``self{''} to a
   patriarchal immigrant ``other,{''} narrated Sweden as a country
   exceptionally concerned with gender, and tapped into competing
   temporalities of progress and decline. The article contributes to
   research on geostrategic communication by showing how disinformation
   efforts draw upon gendered national identities and debates about gender
   and immigration. More importantly, the article demonstrates that such
   gendered boundarymaking shapes audiences' interpretations in crucial
   ways. Rather than viewing disinformation only from a state-centered lens
   of national security, in isolation from racism, Islamophobia,
   anti-feminism, and queerphobia within Western societies, research should
   acknowledge the interconnections between geostrategic communication and
   everyday boundarymaking. This will be pivotal to developing
   counterstrategies to disinformation, whether Russian or homegrown.}},

Abstract = {{Disinformation is a serious problem for democratic systems in open
   societies. It is a global phenomenon that must be studied from different
   approaches and the educational dimension is one of the most relevant. It
   is necessary to know what educational models have been developed to
   empower citizens against disinformation. A systematic review of the
   literature (2011-2020), following the PRISMA protocol, was carried out
   by analyzing articles (n=76) extracted from three databases (Wos, Scopus
   and ERIC). Reference management and text mining software was used to
   data analyse. Eight research questions were answered on the conceptual
   framework, bibliometrics characteristics and pedagogical dimension. From
   the results of the content analysis emerges a vision of the role of
   multiliteracies in educational research and the problem of
   disinformation: media and information literacies are the most relevant
   and news and data literacies are incorporated. The need to adopt
   interdisciplinary approaches is confirmed. From the results of the
   educational dimension, three pedagogical approaches are identified:
   strategies for competencies development; focused on content and
   education for citizenship. Workshops and lesson plans are the most
   common teaching practices. The development of critical thinking,
   experiences in the co-construction of knowledge, and the values of civic

Abstract = {{Prototypical instances of disinformation include deceptive advertising
   (in business and in politics), government propaganda, doctored
   photographs, forged documents, fake maps, internet frauds, fake
   websites, and manipulated Wikipedia entries. Disinformation can cause
   significant harm if people are misled by it. In order to address this
   critical threat to information quality, we first need to understand
   exactly what disinformation is. This paper surveys the various analyses
   of this concept that have been proposed by information scientists and
   philosophers (most notably, Luciano Floridi). It argues that these
   analyses are either too broad (that is, that they include things that
   are not disinformation), or too narrow (they exclude things that are
   disinformation), or both. Indeed, several of these analyses exclude
   important forms of disinformation, such as true disinformation, visual
   disinformation, side-effect disinformation, and adaptive disinformation.
   After considering the shortcomings of these analyses, the paper argues
   that disinformation is misleading information that has the function of
   misleading. Finally, in addition to responding to Floridi's claim that
   such a precise analysis of disinformation is not necessary, it briefly
   discusses how this analysis can help us develop techniques for detecting
   disinformation and policies for deterring its spread.}},

Abstract = {{Decision making, including voting, buying, and other behaviors, is
   constrained by available information. State and non-state actors use
   information operations to try to exploit information constraints to
   influence, manipulate, disrupt, corrupt, or usurp key influencers', mass
   audience's and lay population's ability to make decisions. One way of
   achieving these aims is to disseminate disinformation by using
   information-related capabilities such as cyber operations.
   Disinformation can either increase the uncertainty of the available
   information or can entirely deceive a person. Hence, depending on the
   decision-making level, there can be severe consequences. At the mass
   audience and lay population levels (as opposed to the level of key
   influencers), disinformation can be disseminated very rapidly. The
   populations at these two levels are more susceptible to disinformation
   because they use social media, and mass communication media to access
   information. However, it is difficult to monitor and identify
   disinformation in this open access environment. As a result, people who
   are exposed to disinformation may develop cognitive schemas which, in
   turn, may constrain their future information seeking. Information
   seeking is a cognitive exercise that is applied when people are
   confronted with uncertainty. But a cognitive schema influenced by
   disinformation can result in organizational dysfunction or can deceive
   lay decision makers in daily activities, such as voting, toward the
   desire of an adversary. This paper investigates the lay-population
   disinformation vulnerability problem in three ways: First, from the
   perspective of cyber warfare in which social media can be a major battle
   field to mobilize vulnerable populations towards the desired end.
   Second, an analysis of conceptual modeling problems and issues. Third, a
   proposed preliminary mathematical model of the cognitive schema to
   further illuminate the impact of disinformation.}},

Abstract = {{The concept of disinformation as a tactic to gain advantage over an
   opponent is ancient with examples of its use referenced in Sun Tzu's the
   Art of War written in the sixth century BC. The wide spread use of
   social media has amplified the power of disinformation to affect our
   lives and the nation. In addition, social media has increased the scope
   of the task to mitigate the effects of disinformation beyond what is
   possible by manual processes. This paper summarizes interviews with and
   presentation by security officials at several diverse organizations
   including a financial institution, a large retail corporation, and state
   and federal law enforcement. The findings included proven mitigation
   techniques. These findings, combined with known techniques to measure
   social norms, suggest a possible research path to at least partially
   automate the identification of, and the mitigation against
   disinformation on social media.}},

Month = {{DEC 19}},
Abstract = {{Purpose The purpose of this paper is to investigate and quantify the
   effects of personality traits, as defined by the five-factor model (FFM)
   on an individual's ability to detect fake news. The findings of this
   study are increasingly important because of the proliferation of social
   media news stories and the exposure of organizational stakeholders and
   business decision makers to a tremendous amount of information,
   including information that is not correct (a.k.a. disinformation).
   Design/methodology/approach The data were collected utilizing the
   snowball sampling methodology. Students in an Management Information
   Systems course completed the survey. Since a diverse sample was sought,
   survey participants were instructed to recruit another individual from a
   different generation. The survey questions of the FFM identify
   particular personality traits in respondents. Survey respondents were
   given a collection of nine news stories, five of which were false and
   four that were true. The number of correctly identified stories was
   recorded, and the effect of personality traits on the ability of survey
   respondents to identify fake news was calculated using eta-squared and
   the effect size index. Findings Each of the five factors in the FFM
   demonstrated an effect on an individual's ability to detect
   disinformation. In fact, every single variable studied had at least a
   small effect size index, with one exception: gender, which had basically
   no effect. Therefore, each variable studied (with the exception of
   gender) explained a portion of the variability in the number of
   correctly identified false news stories. Specifically, this quantitative
   research demonstrates that individuals with the following personality
   traits are better able to identify disinformation: closed to experience
   or cautious, introverted, disagreeable or unsympathetic, unconscientious
   or undirected and emotionally stable. Originality/value There is scant
   research on an individual's ability to detect false news stories,
   although some research has been conducted on the ability to detect
   phishing (a type of social engineering attack to obtain funds or
   personal information from the person being deceived). The results of
   this study enable corporations to determine which of their customers,
   investors and other stakeholders are most likely to be deceived by
   disinformation. With this information, they can better prepare for and
   combat the impacts of misinformation on their organization, and thereby
   avoid the negative financial impacts that result.}},

Abstract = {{Previous research has described how highly personalised paid advertising
   on social media platforms can be used to influence voter preferences and

   how search engine optimisation (SEO) strategies are used to target

   at 29 junk news domains and their SEO keyword strategies between January
   2016 and March 2019. I find that SEO - rather than paid advertising - is
   the most important strategy for generating discoverability via Google
   Search. Following public concern over the spread of disinformation
   online, Google's algorithmic changes had a significant impact on junk
   news discoverability. The findings of this research have implications
   for policymaking, as regulators think through legal remedies to combat
   the spread of disinformation online.}},

   presented this persona across multiple platforms and over time.

   authenticity was central to her persona building as a likeable American
   woman, whereas the performance of cultural competence enabled her to
   infiltrate American conservative communities with resonant messages.

Abstract = {{In this paper I develop and present a unified account of information,
   misinformation, and disinformation and their interconnections. The
   unified account is rooted in Paul Grice's notions of natural and
   non-natural meaning (in: Grice (ed) Studies in the way of words. Harvard
   University Press, Cambridge, pp 213-223, 1957) and a corresponding
   distinction between natural and non-natural information (Scarantino and
   Piccinini in Metaphilosophy 41(3):313-330, 2010). I argue that we can
   specify at least three specific kinds of non-natural information. Thus,
   as varieties of non-natural information there is intentionally
   non-misleading information, unintentionally misleading information-i.e.
   misinformation-and intentionally misleading information-i.e.
   disinformation. By shifting the focus from the truth-values of content
   to the intention/intentionality and misleadingness/non-misleadingness of
   that content I obtain a unified account that makes room for the
   potential misleadingness of true content (true disinformation), the
   potential non-misleadingness of false content (irony), and everything in

   Giants to tackle disinformation on the Internet by demonetizing sites

   rewards the production of disinformation based on user data
   surveillance. We conclude that the movement is capable of economically
   weakening uninformative websites and contributing to the generation of
   awareness about the problem of profiting from hate speech, but it is not
   oriented to modify the bases on which the disinformation regime is

Abstract = {{ABSTRACT
   This article delves into the politics of the U.S.-China blame-game
   regarding COVID-19's origin, particularly Chinese disinformation
   narratives attributing the virus's root to the United States. The
   blame-game is symptomatic of contradictory global imaginaries circulated
   within distinct geopolitical spaces. This article approaches Chinese
   disinformation narratives as transnational and intertextual constructs,
   which involve the practices of (mis)translating and referencing foreign
   source texts to paradoxically delegitimate the foreign, especially
   Western, Other; they reinforce what I call self-serving cosmopolitanism,
   a narcissistic and locally conditioned sense of global consciousness
   that is oriented towards the consolidation of self-identity and pride.
   It is my contention that, to combat global disinformation about
   COVID-19, we should foreground the politics of translation, enhance
   cross-cultural sensibility, and most importantly, mobilize a kind of
   counter-politics against the xenophobic nationalism that disinformation
   narratives often parasitize. Cultural scholars with comparative
   perspectives are well positioned to take the initiative in revealing the
   structural issues at play within a global context and in promoting
   genuine cosmopolitan openness.}},

Abstract = {{This essay examines the role of disinformation in the Indian general
   election of 2019. The findings are presented against the background of
   previous work on the role of digital media in Indian politics. The essay
   uses 25 in-depth interviews among ordinary Indians to probe their level
   of awareness about so-called `fake news'. It also examines their
   behavior in seeking news and sharing political information and their
   views about the digital campaign strategies of leaders and parties. The
   interviewees were concerned about the increasing role of religious
   extremism online. Yet they were also strongly aware of the role of
   disinformation campaigns and had strategies for working around being
   misled by information shared on social media. The essay concludes by
   assessing how disinformation and online extremism are likely to have
   affected the 2019 election, and makes comparisons with Modi's election
   in 2014 and with other leaders.}},

Abstract = {{The scale, volume, and distribution speed of disinformation raise

   There is no commonly agreed typology framework, specific categorization
   criteria, and explicit definitions as a basis to assist the further
   investigation of the area. Our work is focused on filling this need. Our
   contribution is twofold. First, we collect the various implicit and
   explicit disinformation typologies proposed by scholars. We consolidate
   the findings following certain design principles to articulate an
   all-inclusive disinformation typology. Second, we propose three
   independent dimensions with controlled values per dimension as
   categorization criteria for all types of disinformation. The taxonomy
   can promote and support further multidisciplinary research to analyze
   the special characteristics of the identified disinformation types.}},

Abstract = {{Online disinformation poses a challenge to democratic societies and has
   become a prominent issue on the research and political agenda. While
   many analyses focus on patterns of distribution and reach of
   disinformation, this article contributes to the analysis of strategies
   to counter disinformation. Employing a governance perspective, it
   provides a descriptive analysis of the emerging mix of governance
   responses in the European system of multilevel governance and on the
   continuum between market and state. Results of the analysis show that
   the proliferation of disinformation on social media has developed from a
   socio-technical mix of platform design, algorithms, human factors and
   political and commercial incentives. Actors and technologies involved
   provide a starting point for targets of governance within an
   accountability network. In practice, national governance responses are
   uneven across the EU, but individual countries pressing for stronger
   regulation of internet platforms and a weakening of liability
   protections. In addition, the European Commission has intensified its
   efforts to combat disinformation and put additional pressure on
   platforms to take action and provide some level of transparency.
   However, clarity about the effects of these measures is blurred by
   contradicting evidence and barriers for research to access platforms and

Abstract = {{If a piece of disinformation released from a terrorist organization
   propagates on Twitter and this adversarial campaign is detected after a
   while, how emergence responders can wisely choose a set of source users
   to start the counter campaign to minimize the disruptive influence of
   disinformation in a short time? This practical problem is challenging
   and critical for authorities to make online social networks a more
   trustworthy source of information. In this work, we propose to study the
   time critical disinformation influence minimization problem in online
   social networks based on a continuous-time multiple campaign diffusion
   model. We show that the complexity of this optimization problem is
   NP-hard and provide a provable guaranteed approximation algorithm for
   this problem by proving several critical properties of the objective
   function. Experimental results on a sample of real online social network
   show that the proposed approximation algorithm outperforms various
   heuristics and the transmission temporal dynamics knowledge is vital for
   selecting the counter campaign source users, especially when the time
   window is small.}},

Title = {{Securitizing Disinformation: The Case of Westminster's Digital, Culture,
   Media and Sport Committee}},
Journal = {{DEMOCRACY \& SECURITY}},
Abstract = {{Major political events around the globe have been subject to
   disinformation campaigns that leverage intentionally misleading content
   to influence public opinion. The disruption created by the
   micro-targeted dissemination of disinformation presents a problem for
   democracies: how should democracies, where legitimacy is derived from
   free and fair elections, respond to this phenomenon? In the United
   Kingdom, Westminster's Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS)
   Committee opened an inquiry into the role of disinformation in the
   Brexit vote that culminated with numerous recommendations. Using
   securitization theory as a framework for analysis, this article explores
   the work of the DCMS Committee and its reception by the UK Government,
   Facebook, and the general public. It contributes to a deeper
   understanding of how democracies can respond to disinformation,
   providing a building block for future studies on state strategies to
   regulate technology platforms. The findings suggest the Committee
   successfully established a securitizing frame around disinformation.}},

Abstract = {{Information disorder (satire or parody, false connections, misleading
   content, false context, imposter content, manipulated content or
   fabricated content) is a social problem that is causing collective
   damages. Women, in particular, are becoming victims of hostilities on
   the digital scenario. This problem is currently known as ``digital
   sexism{''} and ``gender disinformation{''}. In this context,
   verification journalism, a trendy format, aims to reduce the effects of
   hoaxes introducing the fact-checking process in its professional
   routines. However, this is still a minority task. In order to contribute
   to the study of the disinformation phenomenon in relation to online
   messages about women, this research has developed a systematic tool to
   classify hoaxes that have been refuted by the platform Maldita.es,
   specifically, on its sections Maldito Feminismo (N=71). This tool,
   inspired by the taxonomies created by Derakhshan \& Wardle (2017),
   Tandoc, Lim \& Ling (2018) and Molina, Sundar, Le \& Lee (2019), allows
   you to categorize fake news according to the type of information
   disorder, the agent, the message and the interpreter.
   The results of this study (internal validity) show that hoaxes detected
   by Maldito Feminismo are misleading content that expect to damage
   feminism (this is the main topic of fake news) and have a political
   purpose. These information disorders are displayed in text format and
   are mainly created and distributed on social networks. Moreover,
   although users collaborate and participate detecting and reporting
   hoaxes, the platform Maldito Feminismo identifies, locates and denounces
   most of the fake news.}},

   discussed on Sina Weibo}},
Journal = {{TOBACCO INDUCED DISEASES}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{19}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{INTRODUCTION During the COVID-19 pandemic, various types of
   disinformation have emerged from the media. This study focuses on the
   online disinformation about tobacco and the COVID-19 on the Sina Weibo,
   the Chinese largest new media microblog platform. METHODS The related
   posts from the beginning of the epidemic in December 2019 to 19 January
   2021 were searched. Text mining technology was applied on these posts to
   identify content on `smoking can prevent COVID-19'. Descriptive research
   was used to analyze the dataset. RESULTS Among the 912 original posts,
   508 informative posts were selected after artificial recognition,
   including 112 posts of spreading disinformation and 396 which dispel the
   disinformation. Of the disinformation posts, 74\% (83/112) cited the
   results of scientific research, and 17\% (19/112) mentioned that smog
   from burning Asian wormwood could prevent COVID-19. By analyzing the
   public's comments on these 112 disinformation posts, it was suggested
   that about 12\% of the comments were in support, and 88\% of the posts
   were opposed or invalid. The proportion of supportive comments on
   pseudo-scientific information was higher than on plain disinformation,
   21\% and 9\%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS The disinformation of promoting
   smoking as a way to prevent COVID-19 has the typical feature of using
   pseudo-scientific arguments to package disinformation, making it very
   difficult for readers without professional knowledge to identify. Such
   actions harm both tobacco control and COVID-19 prevention.}},

Abstract = {{Political astroturfing, a centrally coordinated disinformation campaign
   in which participants pretend to be ordinary citizens acting
   independently, has the potential to influence electoral outcomes and
   other forms of political behavior. Yet, it is hard to evaluate the scope
   and effectiveness of political astroturfing without ``ground truth{''}
   information, such as the verified identity of its agents and
   instigators. In this paper, we study the South Korean National
   Information Service's (NIS) disinformation campaign during the
   presidential election in 2012, taking advantage of a list of
   participating accounts published in court proceedings. Features that
   best distinguish these accounts from regular users in contemporaneously
   collected Twitter data are traces left by coordination among
   astroturfing agents, instead of the individual account characteristics
   typically used in related approaches such as social bot detection. We
   develop a methodology that exploits these distinct empirical patterns to
   identify additional likely astroturfing accounts and validate this
   detection strategy by analyzing their messages and current account
   status. However, an analysis relying on Twitter influence metrics shows
   that the known and suspect NIS accounts only had a limited impact on
   political social media discussions. By using the principal-agent
   framework to analyze one of the earliest revealed instances of political
   astroturfing, we improve on extant methodological approaches to detect
   disinformation campaigns and ground them more firmly in social science
   theory.}},

Abstract = {{Following public revelations of interference in the United States 2016
   election, there has been widespread concern that online disinformation
   poses a serious threat to democracy. Governments have responded with a
   wide range of policies. However, there is little clarity in elite policy
   debates or academic literature about what it actually means for
   disinformation to endanger democracy, and how different policies might
   protect it. This article proposes that policies to address
   disinformation seek to defend three important normative goods of
   democratic systems: self-determination, accountable representation, and
   public deliberation. Policy responses to protect these goods tend to
   fall in three corresponding governance sectors: self-determination is
   the focus of international and national security policies; accountable
   representation is addressed through electoral regulation; and threats to
   the quality of public debate and deliberation are countered by media
   regulation. The article also reveals some of the challenges and risks in
   these policy sectors, which can be seen in both innovative and failed
   policy designs.}},

Title = {{Black Trolls Matter: Racial and Ideological Asymmetries in Social Media
   Disinformation}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL SCIENCE COMPUTER REVIEW}},
Abstract = {{The recent rise of disinformation and propaganda on social media has
   attracted strong interest from social scientists. Research on the topic
   has repeatedly observed ideological asymmetries in disinformation
   content and reception, wherein conservatives are more likely to view,
   redistribute, and believe such content. However, preliminary evidence
   has suggested that race may also play a substantial role in determining
   the targeting and consumption of disinformation content. Such racial
   asymmetries may exist alongside, or even instead of, ideological ones.
   Our computational analysis of 5.2 million tweets by the Russian
   government-funded ``troll farm{''} known as the Internet Research Agency
   sheds light on these possibilities. We find stark differences in the
   numbers of unique accounts and tweets originating from ostensibly
   liberal, conservative, and Black left-leaning individuals. But diverging
   from prior empirical accounts, we find racial presentation-specifically,
   presenting as a Black activist-to be the most effective predictor of
   disinformation engagement by far. Importantly, these results could only
   be detected once we disaggregated Black-presenting accounts from
   non-Black liberal accounts. In addition to its contributions to the
   study of ideological asymmetry in disinformation content and reception,
   this study also underscores the general relevance of race to
   disinformation studies.}},

Title = {{Assessing the credibility of COVID-19 vaccine mis/disinformation in
   online discussion}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SCIENCE}},
Abstract = {{This study examines how the credibility of the content of mis- or
   disinformation, as well as the believability of authors creating such
   information is assessed in online discussion. More specifically, the
   investigation was focused on the credibility of mis- or disinformation
   about COVID-19 vaccines. To this end, a sample of 1887 messages posted
   to a Reddit discussion group was scrutinised by means of qualitative
   content analysis. The findings indicate that in the assessment of the
   author's credibility, the most important criteria are his or her
   reputation, expertise and honesty in argumentation. In the judgement of
   the credibility of the content of mis/disinformation, objectivity of
   information and plausibility of arguments are highly important. The

Abstract = {{The role of the public relations industry in the disinformation debate
   has been largely overlooked, while an emphasis has been put on the
   responsibilities of platforms, media organisations and audiences to
   monitor content and eliminate fake news. In contrast, this article
   argues that disinformation and fake news are well-established tools in
   public relations work and are implicated in the current crisis. Drawing
   on an exploratory study of UK industry publications about fake news and
   disinformation, the article shows that public relations has addressed
   disinformation as a commercial opportunity and a platform for
   demonstrating professional legitimacy. Industry narratives position
   professional practice as ethical, trustworthy and true, while
   simultaneously `othering' dubious practices and normalising `organised
   lying'. The article concludes by arguing that the fight against
   disinformation must take seriously the impact of public relations, if it
   is to be effective.}},

Abstract = {{Disinformation campaigns such as those perpetrated by far-right groups
   in the United States seek to erode democratic social institutions.
   Looking to understand these phenomena, previous models of disinformation
   have emphasized identity-confirmation and misleading presentation of
   facts to explain why such disinformation is shared. A risk of these
   accounts, which conjure images of echo chambers and filter bubbles, is
   portraying people who accept disinformation as relatively passive
   recipients or conduits. Here we conduct a case study of tactics of
   disinformation to show how platform design and decentralized
   communication contribute to advancing the spread of disinformation even
   when that disinformation is continuously and actively challenged where
   it appears. Contrary to a view of disinformation flowing within
   homogeneous echo chambers, in our case study we observe substantial
   skepticism against disinformation narratives as they form. To examine
   how disinformation spreads amidst skepticism in this case, we employ a
   document-driven multi-site trace ethnography to analyze a contested
   rumor that crossed anonymous message boards, the conservative media
   ecosystem, and other platforms. We identify two important factors that
   filtered out skepticism and contested explanations, which facilitated
   the transformation of this rumor into a disinformation campaign: (1) the
   aggregation of information into evidence collages-image files that
   aggregate positive evidence-and (2) platform filtering-the
   decontextualization of information as these claims crossed platforms.
   Our findings provide an elucidation of ``trading up the chain{''}
   dynamics explored by previous researchers and a counterpoint to the
   relatively mechanistic accounts of passive disinformation propagation
   that dominate the quantitative literature. We conclude with a discussion
   of how these factors relate to the communication power available to
   disparate groups at different times, as well as practical implications
   for inferring intent from social media traces and practical implications
   for the design of social media platforms.}},

Abstract = {{The corona crisis is also a disinformation crisis for the global
   community in general, and for the European Union (EU) in particular.
   What is less clear is how adequate the EU's response to the `infodemic'
   has been. This essay exposes the dangers of disinformation for the EU,
   which have intensified in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, and
   reviews relevant EU responses. It then zooms in on two challenges
   exacerbated by the corona crisis: one internal, revolving around the
   toxic effect of conspiracy theories, particularly the corona-5G hoax;
   and one external, relating to the public diplomacy campaigns of
   competing geopolitical actors, especially China. The essay argues that
   the future of European stability will rest not only on ensuring societal
   resilience to disinformation and conspiracy theories but also on
   designing ethically guided pre-emptive mechanisms and confronting
   external sources of disinformation which jeopardise European health
   provisions, economic recovery and geoeconomic strength.}},

Abstract = {{Disinformation and infodemics have been central for the media policy
   agenda in most countries and in particular in Europe. Yet, the European

   that by focusing primarily on the content level we miss the bigger
   picture where disinformation and infodemics are only symptoms of
   something more important on a media infrastructure level. The commentary
   suggests that we need to reconsider regulation on the infrastructure
   level instead that supports the democratic need for better access to
   verified content by looking at how the current legal structure across
   regulatory silos is benefitting the exact opposite. Furthermore, the
   commentary suggests to specifically address influencers (defined by
   number of followers) in the context of moderation, and lastly suggests
   that user data is ideally stored and governed outside privately owned
   companies in Europe in order to benefit users and society at large.}},

Abstract = {{This paper brings together machine learning and investigative journalism
   to examine sockpuppets accounts, a historical breed of fake accounts
   that are non-automated and human-controlled. Due to their flexible and
   human-centered nature, sockpuppets pose a complication for purely
   technological approaches to detecting and studying fake accounts. We
   find that as machine learning-based detection methods of bots slowly
   grow stronger, adversaries engaging in disinformation are turning to
   such sockpuppets accounts, and in particular a subset of sockpuppets
   that we call ``infiltrators{''} - those that aim to integrate into a
   community in order spread disinformation. This represents a new stage in
   the evolution of the sockpuppet concept: where bots seek to simulate
   audiences and drown online social media platforms with a particular
   point of view, infiltrators seek to persuade and assimilate genuine
   audiences from within. In addition to these insights into infiltrator
   sockpuppets, combining machine learning and investigative journalism
   enables learning something more than detection and important patterns of
   activity: it can also gain a sense of the motivations and reasoning of
   adversaries who engage in disinformation.}},

Abstract = {{This paper focuses on digital behaviour, self-assessment of

   (implemented between February and March 2018) with the Special
   Eurobarometer no. 464 - Fake News and Disinformation Online -
   implemented in the same time frame (February 2018), we capture the
   perceptions and attitudes of Romanian citizens over the use of new media
   and news trustworthiness, and we also compare the Romanians' online
   behaviour with the average European's. As similar research reveals,
   digital disinformation affects resilience of citizens in Member States
   and in the European Union overall, it ``threatens the democratic
   political processes and values{''} (European Commission, 2018: 12), the
   integrity of elections and political processes, and should therefore, be

Abstract = {{This comparative case analysis focuses on the approaches of the Czech

   state. It employs a rational model of policy-making to better understand
   the rationale for the decisions of the actors leading to the different
   approaches taken by the governments of the examined states. The analysis
   shows that while the Czech approach seems to be driven mostly by
   security interests, in Slovakia, the economic goals are of primary
   importance, with the primary factor being the importance of energy
   relations with Russia. The Czech approach is considered as an
   appropriate one in this paper, as it allows for more objective threat
   assessment and consequently better preparedness and resilience, whereas
   a rather pragmatic approach of Slovakia leads to increasing
   vulnerability of disinformation activities.}},

   the respondents (54\%) have encountered misleading or false information;
   30\% thought that ``the COVID-19-related chaos is beneficial to
   politicians{''}, while 17\% believed that ``COVID-19 is like flu{''}.
   Respondents with a higher level of education and more active media usage
   habits are more likely to recognise disinformation about COVID-19.
   Moreover, this skill is linked to a higher degree of perceived threat of
   the disease. Yet, those who rate their risk of disease as very high,
   alongside those who rate their risk of disease as low and unreal, are
   `infodemically' vulnerable - more susceptible to disinformation, false
   news, and conspiracy theories. Recommendations to communicators about
   curbing the diffusion of disinformation and diminishing its impact are
   provided.}},

Abstract = {{While biological warfare has classically been considered a threat
   requiring the presence of a distinct biological agent, we argue that in
   light of the rise of state-sponsored online disinformation campaigns we
   are approaching a fifth phase of biowarfare with a ``cyber-bio{''}
   framing. By examining the rise of measles cases following disinformation
   campaigns connected to the US 2016 presidential elections, the rise of
   disinformation in the current novel coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic,
   and the impact of misinformation on public health interventions during
   the 2014-2016 West Africa and 2019-2020 Democratic Republic of the Congo
   Ebola outbreaks, we ask whether the potential impact of these
   campaigns-which includes the undermining of sociopolitical systems, the
   delegitimization of public health and scientific bodies, and the
   diversion of the public health response-can be characterized as
   analogous to the impacts of more traditional conceptions of biowarfare.
   In this paper, we look at these different impacts and the norms related
   to the use of biological weapons and cyber campaigns. By doing so, we
   anticipate the advent of a combined cyber and biological warfare. The
   latter is not dependent on the existence of a manufactured biological
   weapon; it manages to undermine sociopolitical systems and public health
   through the weaponization of naturally occurring outbreaks.}},

Abstract = {{Yes, Minister is a series that has been part of the collective
   imagination of citizens in many English-speaking countries since the
   1980s, in which disinformation is frequently used or mentioned by its
   main characters. Its enormous impact has been long-lasting, and in
   recent years it has gained special prominence on YouTube. The objectives
   of this paper are the following: a) to quantify the presence of
   fragments of the series Yes, Minister on YouTube, including their
   titles, the episodes to which they belong, their duration and the number
   of views and comments; and b) to analyse the processes, strategies and
   mechanisms of disinformation in these fragments. To this end, we first
   described the fragments with more than 200,000 views, of which there
   were forty. After this analysis, we chose the videos with more than
   400,000 views and, in those, analysed the processes, strategies and
   mechanisms of disinformation. There were twenty-two such documents and
   they contained as many as 125 samples of disinformation: mostly
   associated with the process of concealment, followed by blurring and,
   thirdly, invention. We went on to check for the presence of the nine
   strategies linked to these processes (abolition, segmentation,
   deviation, saturation, alteration, divergence, impersonation,
   incorporation and transformation). Abolition and alteration
   predominated. Finally, we described the main mechanisms by which these
   strategies materialised, which included contradiction, confusion,
   ambiguity, exaggeration, interruption, separation and assignment. We
   conclude that the publication of the series fragments on the networks
   indicates public interest in political disinformation. Their use in
   formal educational contexts, based on analyses such as the one in this
   paper, is a valuable approach for dealing with discursive processes and
   mechanisms of disinformation in different areas of knowledge.}},

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{JUL 14}},
Abstract = {{During the first few months of the COVID-19 pandemic, a 26-min
   documentary entitled Plandemic was released online and fanatically
   shared via Twitter and other major social media platforms. The producers
   of the documentary sought to spread misinformation and conspiracy
   theories and to discredit scientific experts using a sophisticated
   disinformation campaign. They set out to accomplish this by coaching
   citizens toward activism to maximize the speed at which the documentary
   propagated and decrease positive sentiments toward public health
   interventions. Applying techniques from social network analysis in
   conjunction with a formative content analysis of Twitter data, we
   examined the effectiveness of the Plandemic disinformation campaign as a
   case study of social engineering during the COVID-19 pandemic. By
   comparing the Twitter network's community structure and communication
   patterns before and after the release of the film, we demonstrate the
   Plandemic campaign to have been effective for two reasons. First, the
   campaign established a decentralized information sharing network on
   Twitter by coaching low-reach social media users to mass share the
   documentary, effectively subverting efforts to gatekeep its
   misinformation. Second, the campaign amplified negative sentiments
   regarding vaccination and containment measures among conspiracy
   theorists. These effects possibly have an indirect impact on the
   public's willingness to comply with public health measures. Our results
   show the necessity of further research about sophisticated social
   experiments such as the Plandemic disinformation campaign and provide
   important insights for policy-making to combat the spread of health
   misinformation during public health crises.}},

Title = {{Is Sensationalist Disinformation More Effective? Three Facilitating
   Factors at the National, Individual, and Situational Level}},
Journal = {{DIGITAL JOURNALISM}},
Abstract = {{Throughout the current global health crisis, false and misleading
   content has proliferated on social media. Previous research indicates
   that users of social media primarily share information that contains
   attention-grabbing elements. Because sensationalist elements are
   prevalent in disinformation, this study examines the role of
   sensationalism in supporting disinformation. We conducted survey
   experiments in six countries (N = 7,009), presenting versions of a false
   claim that differed in their degree of sensationalism. We varied three
   contextual conditions for disinformation support: whether respondents
   grew up in a tabloid-oriented national news culture, whether they
   indicated individual usage preferences for tabloid and alternative
   media, and how they rated their situational uncertainty during the
   pandemic. Our results show a weak influence of tabloidized cultures, but
   people who frequently use tabloid or alternative media are more likely
   to agree with disinformation. Users who are uncertain about what is true
   and what is false are also more likely to agree with disinformation,
   especially when it is presented sensationally. The average user,
   however, is more likely to agree with disinformation that is presented
   neutrally. This finding is concerning, as disinformation presented in a
   sober manner is much harder to detect by those who want to fight the
   ``infodemic.{''}}},

   disinformation, ``fake news{''} and cyber propaganda, which cast a
   shadow on the integrity of the election outcome. In March, 2018, details
   emerged of the claims by Cambridge Analytica that it had engineered a
   digital campaign that painted Uhuru Kenyatta in positive light while
   smearing the image of his main rival, Raila Odinga, behind the scenes.
   The contested results for the two presidential elections in August and
   October were largely dismissed as ``fake computer-generated results{''}
   due to the alleged cyber propaganda and the extensive spread of
   disinformation. Data were collected through a qualitative content
   analysis of some of the texts circulated on social media. The guiding

Abstract = {{This paper analyzes the spreaded disinformation about the coronavirus in
   Spain and Latin America in the 01/23/2020-05/03/2020 period. A
   quantitative analysis of the following variables has been carried out:
   volume of disinformation by country (as well as its over time
   evolution), type of disinformation, channel of dissemination, sources of
   disinformation and misleading circulation networks between countries. In
   the case of Spain, the correlation between disinformation production and
   pandemic evolution and trends searches about coronavirus issues has also
   been studied. The results clearly show that the evolution of the
   pandemic influences the propagation of hoaxes, triggered at critical
   moments such as the pandemic declaration made by the WHO. In the case of
   Spain, the higher growth rate of the disinformation curve matches the
   higher number of searches on the subject.}},

Abstract = {{In previous research, I outlined some of the new challenges that the
   European Union was facing in producing communication policies due to the
   increase in disinformation. The EU, alarmed by the mass dissemination of
   fake news during the presidential elections of 2016 in the USA or around
   Brexit in the UK, began work on stopping this phenomenon in Europe. The
   first step was to recognise the magnitude of the problem, and in order
   to face it, in June 2017 the European Parliament adopted a Resolution in
   which it urges the European Commission to analyse the legal framework
   existing in the fight against disinformation, and also the possibility
   of intervening at a legislative level in order to check this phenomenon
   was assessed. Fighting against disinformation is a longdistance race in
   which it is hard to keep up to the speed of technological advances and
   the consumption of news, but it is fundamental to maintain legality in
   actions in order to put a brake on this disinformation as these actions
   can become a justification for limiting freedom of expression or
   privacy, putting fundamental human rights at risk.}},

   Addressing the Actual Challenges to Democracy}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL MEDIA + SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Current debate is dominated by fears of the threats of digital
   technology for democracy. One typical example is the perceived threats
   of malicious actors promoting disinformation through digital channels to
   sow confusion and exacerbate political divisions. The prominence of the
   threat of digital disinformation in the public imagination, however, is
   not supported by empirical findings which instead indicate that
   disinformation is a limited problem with limited reach among the public.
   Its prominence in public discourse is instead best understood as a
   ``moral panic.{''} In this article, we argue that we should shift
   attention from these evocative but empirically marginal phenomena of
   deviance connected with digital media toward the structural
   transformations that give rise to these fears, namely those that have
   impacted information flows and attention allocation in the public arena.
   This account centers on structural transformations of the public arena
   and associated new challenges, especially in relation to gatekeepers,
   old and new. How the public arena serves actually existing democracy
   will not be addressed by focusing on disinformation, but rather by
   addressing structural transformations and the new challenges that arise
   from these.}},

Abstract = {{Online disinformation is considered a major challenge for modern
   democracies. It is widely understood as misleading content produced to
   generate profits, pursue political goals, or maliciously deceive. Our
   starting point is the assumption that some countries are more resilient
   to online disinformation than others. To understand what conditions
   influence this resilience, we choose a comparative cross-national
   approach. In the first step, we develop a theoretical framework that
   presents these country conditions as theoretical dimensions. In the
   second step, we translate the dimensions into quantifiable indicators
   that allow us to measure their significance on a comparative
   cross-country basis. In the third part of the study, we empirically
   examine eighteen Western democracies. A cluster analysis yields three
   country groups: one group with high resilience to online disinformation
   (including the Northern European systems, for instance) and two country
   groups with low resilience (including the polarized Southern European
   countries and the United States). In the final part, we discuss the
   heuristic value of the framework for comparative political communication
   research in the age of information pollution.}},

Abstract = {{When communication professionals were still asking themselves how
   companies could survive and prosper in the era of hyper-transparency
   while keeping all reputational risks under control, an unexpected
   situation appeared that is now generating two problems that were still
   in the process of being addressed in terms of how to integrate such
   risks into corporate reputation management. One difficulty is
   incorporating reputational risk into the corporate risk architecture;
   the other involves addressing the risks induced by disinformation, which
   is a new setback for corporate reputation. This study investigates the
   planning that takes place in Spanish companies regarding the effects of
   media disinformation on corporate reputation and the perception of such
   disinformation as a corporate risk to be included among all other
   reputational risks. As such, our intention is to confirm the extent to
   which Spanish companies accept the danger of disinformation, and the
   degree to which they consider the latter to be a new reputational risk
   that may be more urgent and serious when a situation such as the current
   worldwide pandemic occurs without warning. The main conclusion is that
   the risks related to disinformation reinforce the gap between
   professional perception and organisational priorities.}},

Abstract = {{The article deals with the analysis of disinformation in a media text.
   Disinformation is defined as information which promotes cognitive biases
   and cannot be critically evaluated by a recipient because it violates
   the Cooperative Principle maxims. After analysing media texts using the
   pragma-linguistic and structural approaches, it is concluded (1)
   misleading information is often located in rhythmically structured
   intervals of a media text; (2) disinformation is a statement or
   proposition that violates the maxims of quality, manner, relation, and
   quantity. Most frequently, the maxim of manner is violated. The rather
   general proposition allows for multiple, obscure, and ambiguous
   interpretations. The maxim of relation is violated when cited sources
   are not exactly relevant to the arguments stated in a media text but is
   used to manipulate recipients' perception. The maxim of quality is often
   violated when media strives to share something sensational and post the
   unchecked information. Repetition in media texts is a matter of
   attracting abundance which violated the maxim of quantity. Repetition
   forms the symmetrical structure of a media text which facilitates
   perception and information from symmetrically structured intervals is
   easier to be remembered. The findings pose a challenge to the
   possibility of detection of disinformation. The study has a contribution
   to the existing knowledge in the area of pragmatics and structural
   linguistics. (c) 2019 Published by Future Academy

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The bounded confidence model has been widely used to formally study
   groups of agents who are sharing opinions with those in their epistemic
   neighborhood. We revisit the model with an eye toward studying misand
   disinformation campaigns, which have been much in the news of late. To
   that end, we introduce typed agents into the model, specifically agents
   who can be irresponsible in different ways, most notably, by being
   deceitful, but also by being reluctant to try and obtain information
   from the world directly. We further add a mechanism of confidence
   dynamics to the model, which-among other things- allows agents to adapt
   the closeness threshold for counting others as being their epistemic
   neighbors. This will be used to study the effectiveness of possible
   defense mechanisms against misand disinformation efforts. (c) 2020

Abstract = {{Introduction: scientific disinformation has been a strong ally
   responsible for making it increasingly difficult to cope with the
   disease caused by the new coronavirus. Negative views, conspiracy
   theories, political opportunism are some examples of malicious use
   behind the dissemination of information about the virus, its effects,
   forms of treatment and prevention. Method: it develops an
   infodemiological approch, and the research analyzes the
   prohydroxychloroquine message sharing on Twitter, the drug that has
   gained prominence when talking about possible pharmacological treatment
   of the disease. It collects data via Netlytic, by monitoring the hashtag
   \#hydroxychloroquine between 11th to 30th of May, and analyze it based
   on the social network analysis, the understanding of frequent terms and
   categorization of tweets. Results: It analyzes 3.714 tweets, and
   identifies 2.089 users. Only 678 users (32.4\%) maintained a connection
   with other users on the network. The frequent terms and their
   distribution indicate that the issue is played more by political aspects
   than by health, with a greater concentration of messages in a few users
   and a large number responsible for its viralization. The most common
   categories were ``Attack on political agents{''} and ``Disbelief in
   epistemic institutions.{''}. Conclusions: in the context studied, it is
   clear that the values of the scientific culture itself, such as
   recognition and authority, are gaining new informational layers in
   political dispute at a time when epistemic institutions are in decline.}},

Abstract = {{Policy discourse about disinformation focuses heavily on the
   technological dimensions of state-sponsored disinformation campaigns.
   Unfortunately, this myopic focus on technology has led to insufficient
   attention being paid to the underlying human factors driving the success
   of state-sponsored disinformation campaigns. Academic research on
   disinformation strongly suggests that belief in false or misleading
   information is driven more by individual emotional and cognitive
   responses - amplified by macro social, political and cultural trends -
   than specific information technologies. Thus, attention given to
   countering the distribution and promulgation of disinformation through
   specific technological platforms, at the expense of understanding the
   human factors at play, hampers the ability of public diplomacy efforts
   countering it. This article addresses this lacuna by reviewing the
   underlying psychology of three common types of state-sponsored
   disinformation campaigns and identifying lessons for designing effective
   public diplomacy counter-strategies in the future.}},

   Campaigns}},
Journal = {{MEDIA AND COMMUNICATION}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{217-228}},
Abstract = {{As fake news elicits an emotional response from users, whose attention
   is then monetised, political advertising has a significant influence on
   its production and dissemination. Facebook ads, therefore, have an
   essential role in contemporary political communication, not only because
   of their extensive use in international political campaigns, but also
   because they address intriguing questions about the regulation of
   disinformation on social networking sites. This research employs a
   corpus of 14,684 Facebook ads published by the major national political
   parties during their campaigns leading up to the two Spanish general
   elections held in 2019. A manual content analysis was performed on all
   the visually identical ads so as to identify those containing
   disinformation and those denouncing it. The topics addressed in these
   ads were then examined. The results show that the political parties'
   Facebook ad strategies were akin to those of conventional advertising.
   Disinformation messages were infrequent and mainly posted by Ciudadanos
   and VOX. Nonetheless, it is striking that the main topic addressed in
   the ads was the unity of Spain-precisely the issue of Catalonia's
   independence. In light of this, it can be deduced that `traditional'
   parties are taking longer to renounce classical forms of campaigning
   than their `new' counterparts, thus demonstrating that the actors
   implementing disinformation strategies are not only restricted to the
   extreme right of the ideological spectrum.}},

Journal = {{ECONOMIC ANTHROPOLOGY}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{7-21}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Recent scholarship indicates that populist rhetoric can profoundly shape
   commonsense understandings of global energy crises. While scholars often
   depict rural, working-class communities as objects of right-wing
   disinformation, posttruths, and alternative facts, how rural communities
   interpret or experience populist narratives is far from adequately
   understood. This research examines the recent coal industry recession in
   coal-producing areas of Appalachian Kentucky, which contributed to ten
   thousand job losses since 2010. Amid the downturn, politicians and
   pro-coal lobby groups riled the public by blaming the recession on an
   alleged ``war on coal.{''} This article illustrates how neoliberal
   disinformation underpins war-on-coal narratives claiming that
   deregulating industry is the only way communities can save the industry
   and access economic well-being. Drawing from qualitative interviews,
   participant observation, and discourse analysis, I explore how
   war-on-coal disinformation becomes a commonsense explanation for many
   dealing with coal industry recession. While findings suggest that the
   war on coal ``makes sense{''} for many living in coal-mining
   communities, this does not indicate an indeterminate embrace of the
   industry or pro-coal rhetoric. Communities negotiate commonsense
   narratives against complicated relationships with the industry, the many
   dangers of mining, and the challenges coal poses for alternative
   economic futures.}},

Abstract = {{The Brexit referendum is a good example of the particular vulnerability
   of the European project when fighting disinformation. Therefore, EU
   institutions have developed a series of initiatives throughout 2018 to
   define a European strategy to counter disinformation that emphasizes the
   responsibility of social networks in reporting false content. In
   addition, given the weakness of the European public sphere, the European
   institutions support the creation of European networks of fact checkers.
   This strategy implies the denunciation of lies, rather than the
   promotion of alternative interpretive frames, which authors like Lakoff
   (2004) consider an error from a framing point of view. Empirically, we
   demonstrate through an analysis of the main networks of actors on this
   matter (academics, foundations, think tanks, media, social network
   platforms and fact checkers) that there is a dispute to define the best
   way to combat disinformation at the European level.}},

Abstract = {{The People's Republic of China (PRC) is waging a disinformation campaign
   against the U.S.-led international system. China uses disinformation to
   translate its economic power into Great Power prestige and to suppress
   external and internal criticism of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).
   Both objectives are intended to bolster the domestic legitimacy of the
   party and enhance social stability. By linking stability and prestige
   with economic expansion, the CCP hopes to avoid the `Tacitus Trap' - an
   existential legitimacy crisis caused by losing the confidence of the
   people. As a third function, disinformation also obscures Beijing's
   efforts to influence and manipulate foreign policies of global actors
   with respect to China, thus undermining international transparency and
   the democratic structures and processes of target states. The U.S.
   response has been ad hoc and reactive, therefore ineffectual.}},

   this article investigates the impact of COVID-19 digital fake news
   exposure on individuals' perceived susceptibility of influence on
   themselves, their close others, and their distant others. Findings from
   a survey of 511 Chinese respondents suggest that, overall, individuals
   would perceive themselves to be less vulnerable than close others and
   distant others to the impact of COVID-19 digital disinformation. The
   highest self-other perceptual discrepancy is found when individuals
   receive disinformation on mobile social networking apps. Also,
   individuals who practice more active fact-checking perceive themselves
   to be less susceptible. The perception of disinformation effects on self
   as well as the self-other perceptual discrepancy is both positively
   related to emotional responses (anxiety, fear, and worry) to the
   COVID-19 pandemic. This study contributes to existing research by
   linking exposure to disinformation in different digital channels, the
   TPEs, and emotional outcomes in the context of a public health crisis.
   It also highlights the importance of educating and enabling
   fact-checking behaviors on digital media, which could help to reduce
   negative emotional impact of the disinformation.}},

Abstract = {{It is important to identify disinformation and figure out the degree of
   its impact to effectively confront it. The aim of the article is to
   determine the impact of a misinforming media text applying a combination
   of methods. I calculate the number of occurrences of words, do the
   morphological analysis of words to build up a corpus of misinforming
   media texts. The pragmatic, frequency, and positional analyses reveal
   suggestion in media texts. The data revealed statistically corresponds
   to the positional distribution of repeated words and pragmatically
   significant lexemes. Positioned in a rhythmically structured media text,
   disinformation influences readers suggestively: it invokes negative
   public sentiments and eventually affects the public opinion. Due to
   deliberate misinformation in media texts, Russia appears to be an
   aggressor that hacks strategically important systems in order to
   undermine and disrupt them. A misinforming media text is used as the
   tool of information-psychological warfare. There are anonymous sources,
   generalizations, generic terms, and the repetition of pragmatically
   relevant lexemes among information warfare suggestive techniques. (C)

   to contribute to understanding of the phenomenon by clarifying the

   broadcasters. Exploratory research was conducted on news published in
   newspapers in recent years and subsequently unmasked as fake news.
   Accordingly, a classification model of disinformation phenomena from the
   journalist's intention as sender was established. In addition, a review
   of paradigmatic cases helping to systematise the distinctive features of
   journalistic texts containing fake news and, subsequently, not
   disseminating quality information, was performed. The lack of a
   repository of false news originating from, or disseminated by
   newspapers, limited the conclusions drawn. However, the proposed study
   paradigm helps to delimit the position of journalists in the phenomenon
   of disinformation, provides an alert to the presence of obvious signs of
   disinformation in texts not designed for this purpose and, hence, shows
   the need to expand the concept of disinformation itself to encompass

Abstract = {{COVID-19 has not only meant a health emergency but also a truly

   the specific actions that the European institutions have developed in
   Spain. Our approach is based on a theoretical review and an overview of
   the actions implemented in the coronavirus context. We use the study of
   cases research strategy to evaluate interesting examples, both
   traditional and social media. As a result, there is a notable concern
   from EU institutions about disinformation, thanks to previous experience
   with the Brexit referendum in 2016 and the 2019 European elections. The
   actions carried out in Spain are in line with its media literacy needs,

Abstract = {{This research addresses the impact of disinformation and media
   illiteracy on civil discourse and informed societal activity in the
   United States. The research provides analysis of the conditions
   surrounding disinformation and media illiteracy, as well one proposed
   solution for the problem: a media literacy educational program for both
   digital and non-digital natives via an international alliance of
   experts. Initially, the ``Digital Divide{''} of the early 21st century
   referenced individuals unable to access digital information with the
   same efficiency as those individuals in a household with a personal
   computer. In 2007, the introduction of smart phone technology
   transformed some of the Digital Divide population by providing
   information previously restricted to individuals with PC access to
   anyone who owned a phone. However, frequency of use is not the
   equivalent of mastery or thorough understanding. In 2016, the
   disinformation campaigns surrounding the U.S. presidential election, and
   later popular culture campaigns such as supposed controversy surrounding
   Disney's The Last Jedi, emerged as foreign interference with American
   culture exploiting cultural divides. This research addresses two things:
   (1) Recognition of a caveat to the Knowledge Gap Theory in 21st century
   media interaction; and (2) Creation of a media literacy educational
   program via an international coalition for the sole purpose of combating
   disinformation.}},

Abstract = {{Traditional news outlets as carriers and distributors of information
   have been challenged by online social networks with regards to their
   gate-keeping function. We believe that only a combined effort of people
   and machines will be able to curb so-called ``fake news{''} at scale in
   a decentralized Web. In this position paper, we propose an approach to
   design social machines that coordinate human- and machine-driven
   credibility assessment of information on a decentralized Web. To this
   end, we defined a fact-checking process that draws upon ongoing efforts
   for tackling disinformation on the Web, and we formalized this process
   as a multi-agent organisation for curating W3C Web Annotations. We
   present the current state of our prototypical implementation in the form
   of a browser plugin that builds on the Hypothesis annotation platform
   and the JaCaMo multi-agent platform. Our social machines would span
   across the Web to enable collaboration in form of public discourse,
   thereby increasing the transparency and accountability of information.}},

   president of Brazil, due to the political-ideological alignment between
   Donald Trump and Jair Bolsonaro, who had a contradictory position in the

   of notification in countries to carry out Content Analysis through the
   program IRaMuTeQ, based on the theoretical-conceptual framework on

Abstract = {{Social media is undoubtedly a widely used communication platform that
   affords easier sharing and access to information. Even though social
   media is used for benevolent purposes, a few use this platform for
   deviant activities such as cyberbullying, cyber warfare or propaganda,
   disinformation and fake news dissemination to influence the masses. With
   the availability of inexpensive and ubiquitous mass communication tools
   like social media, disseminating false information and propaganda is
   both convenient and effective. Social media in general and blogs in
   particular act as virtual spaces where narratives are framed. In order
   to generate discourse, web traffic needs to be driven to these virtual
   spaces. Social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, and other
   websites are therefore used as vehicles to disseminate the content. This
   link between blogs and social media platforms is vital to examine
   disinformation campaigns. In this research, we examine the role of media
   orchestration strategies, more specifically, cross-media and mix-media
   strategies in conducting disinformation campaigns. The paper presents an
   in-depth examination of the information networks using social network
   analysis and cyber forensic-based methodology, to identify prominent
   information actors and leading coordinators of the disinformation
   campaigns. Using the developed research methodology, the study reveals a
   massive disinformation coordination campaign pertaining to the Baltic
   region conducted primarily on blogs but strategically linking to a
   variety of other social media platforms, e.g., Twitter, Facebook,
   YouTube, VKontakte, among others.}},

Title = {{Mistake or Manipulation? Conceptualizing Perceived Mis- and
   Disinformation among News Consumers in 10 European Countries}},
Journal = {{COMMUNICATION RESEARCH}},
Abstract = {{In the midst of heated debates surrounding the veracity and honesty of
   communication, scholarly attention has turned to the conceptualization
   of mis- and disinformation on the supply-side of (political)
   communication. Yet, we lack systematic research on the conceptualization
   of perceived mis- and disinformation on the demand-side. Original survey
   data collected in ten European countries (N = 6,643) shows that news
   consumers distinguish general misinformation from disinformation. Yet,
   the high correlation between the two dimensions indicates that
   disinformation perceptions may be regarded as a sub-type of
   misinformation perceptions in which intentional deception is a core
   element. This paper aims to make a contribution to the misinformation
   and media credibility literature by proposing a first conceptualization
   of perceived untruthfulness corresponding to increasing levels of
   cynicism and skepticism toward the factual status and honesty of
   information.}},

Abstract = {{The Kremlin, under the leadership of President Vladimir Putin, has
   sponsored a resurgence of political warfare against Western targets.
   This analysis will focus on a particular aspect of Kremlin-sponsored
   political warfare: sexuality and gender-based narratives in Russian and
   pro-Russian disinformation campaigns targeting EU and EU aspiring
   members from 2015-2020. The potency of these narratives arises from the
   emotional and cognitive load that they elicit. Their significance is
   often overlooked in security, intelligence, and communication studies.
   In order to alleviate this gap, this article consists of a mixed-methods
   investigation in order to analyze the role and function of these
   narratives within the larger body of Russian disinformation. This
   research shows that sexuality and gender-based disinformation narratives
   are designed to target basic human emotions, such as fear, anger,
   hostility, confusion, and disgust, by exploiting existing cognitive
   biases within the targeted population. These narratives are a useful and
   effective political and propaganda tool meant to elicit support for a
   specific brand of traditional values that furthers the Kremlin's
   geopolitical aim of creating an alternative to Western liberal hegemony.}},

   narratives that strategically target and exploit identity-based
   differences in accord with pre-existing power structures to maintain
   hegemonic social orders. In proposing and developing the concept of
   identity propaganda, we especially aim to help researchers find new
   insights into their data on misinformation, disinformation, and
   propaganda by outlining a framework for unpacking layers of historical
   power relations embedded in the content they analyze. We focus on three
   forms of identity propaganda: othering narratives that alienate and
   marginalize non-white or non-dominant groups; essentializing narratives
   that create generalizing tropes of marginalized groups; and
   authenticating narratives that call upon people to prove or undermine
   their claims to be part of certain groups. We demonstrate the utility of
   this framework through our analysis of identity propaganda around Vice
   President Kamala Harris during the 2020 US presidential election.}},

Abstract = {{Climate change presents a challenge at multiple levels: It challenges
   our cognitive abilities because the effect of the accumulation of
   emissions is difficult to understand. Climate change also challenges
   many people's world-view because any climate mitigation regime will have
   economic and political implications that are incompatible with
   libertarian ideals of unregulated free markets. These political
   implications have created an environment of rhetorical adversity in
   which disinformation abounds, thus compounding the challenges for
   climate communicators. The existing literature on how to communicate
   climate change and dispel misinformation converges on several
   conclusions: First, providing information about climate change, in
   particular explanations of why it occurs, can enhance people's
   acceptance of science. Second, highlighting the scientific consensus can
   be an effective means to counter misinformation and raise public
   acceptance. Third, culturally aligned messages and messengers are more
   likely to be successful. Finally, climate misinformation is best
   defanged, through a process known as inoculation, before it is
   encountered, although debunking techniques can also be successful.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the participation of bots in the process of
   disinformation in the Brazilian political/ electoral scenario between
   2014 and 2018. The justification for this research was the growth of
   ideological polarization and the emergence of hate speech linked to
   political positioning that culminated in a massive campaign of
   disinformation, evidenced by fake news and other forms of manipulation.
   In this research multiple case studies were used referring to three
   moments: the 2014 elections, the 2016 impeachment and the 2018 election.
   We found studies investigating these events, and they were used as data
   sources for analysis of the conjuncture and the interpre-tation of these
   facts in a chronological perspective pointed toward the role of bots and
   the results of such actions. It has been observed that the use of bots
   has occurred since 2014; however, they were only engaged in propagating
   false content from 2015. The automation of the messages was
   sophisticated between 2014 and 2018, when bots ceased to be players who
   replicated posts indiscriminately (spam) to become users' catalysts with
   the intention of creating or expanding new bubbles of disinformation.
   Finally, we observed that the same botnet active in Brazil was also
   involved in electoral processes around the world, making Brazil simply
   one more piece in this grand network of disinformation where who is
   involved and what their purpose might be is not known.}},

Abstract = {{What are the pathways for spreading disinformation on social media
   platforms? This article addresses this question by collecting,
   categorising, and situating an extensive body of research on how
   application programming interfaces (APIs) provided by social media

   landscape of official social media APIs, then perform quantitative
   research on the open-source code repositories GitHub and GitLab to
   understand the usage patterns of these APIs. By inspecting the code
   repositories, we classify developers' usage of the APIs as official and
   unofficial, and further develop a four-stage framework characterising
   pathways for spreading disinformation on social media platforms. We
   further highlight how the stages in the framework were activated during
   the 2016 US Presidential Elections, before providing policy
   recommendations for issues relating to access to APIs, algorithmic
   content, advertisements, and suggest rapid response to coordinate
   campaigns, development of collaborative, and participatory approaches as
   well as government stewardship in the regulation of social media

Abstract = {{This article explores how digital communications platforms are used in
   the aftermath of terrorist attacks to amplify or constrain the wider
   social impacts and consequences of politically motivated violence.
   Informed by empirical data collected by monitoring social media
   platforms following four terrorist attacks in the UK in 2017, the
   analysis focusses on the role of `soft facts' (rumours/conspiracy
   theories/fake news/propaganda) in influencing public understandings and
   definitions of the situation. Specifically, it identifies three digital
   influence engineering techniques - spoofing, truthing and social
   proofing - that are associated with the communication of misinformation
   and disinformation. After configuring these concepts, the authors
   consider their implications for policy and practice development,
   concluding that, to date, possibilities for evidence-informed post-event
   preventative interventions have been relatively neglected in the
   formulation of counter-terrorism strategies. They recommend more
   attention be paid to how strategic communications interventions can
   counteract the effects of misinformation and disinformation, and thus
   mitigate the wider public harms induced by terror events.}},

   of current research on the scale and effect of organised Russian

   government about how to deal with the problem. This narrative reveals a
   complex interplay between defending democracy, while maintaining a

Abstract = {{In this work we provide preliminary results from an ongoing
   investigation on the Twitter diffusion of news pertaining to two classes
   of sources, namely websites which notably produce disinformation, i.e.
   misleading and harmful information, opposed to more traditional and
   mainstream websites which instead publish credible information. We used
   the Twitter Streaming API to collect a large-scale dataset of thousands
   of tweets containing links to news articles in two different countries,
   Italy and France. We show that mainstream news outlets generate a much
   larger engagement in both settings, with a larger discrepancy between
   the two news domains in France. We also show that only a handful of
   Italian outlets actively engage with Twitter users, whereas in France
   there is a larger number of outlets sharing misleading information which
   exhibit a non-negligible volume of shares. We observe a strong tendency
   towards sharing mainstream news in those users who also share
   non-credible information in both countries. Analyzing the diffusion
   networks of distinct news domains and countries, we observed that
   disinformation networks are more clustered and connected, but much
   smaller than the mainstream ones (with the largest discrepancy in the
   French scenario).}},

Abstract = {{Our paper focuses on one of the newest challenges for the education
   system: the design and implementation of proper interventions as a
   response to the proliferation of fake news and online disinformation in
   the digital ecosystem.
   The European Commission included media and information literacy (MIL)
   among the most sought-after solutions in dealing with online
   communication disorders. Defined as the capacity of the audience to use
   and interact with the media, and to assess its contents in a critical
   manner, MIL enables citizens to understand the new information
   environment of the digital age and to take more informed decisions,
   reducing their vulnerability to disinformation. Raising awareness and
   improving societal resilience is one of the four pillars of the EU's
   Action Plan to counter disinformation in Europe, and one main ways to
   reach this objective is through MIL interventions for all ages.
   Reflecting on the increased relevance of the topic, we provide insights
   on the extant research on MIL interventions for building resilience to
   fake news. In the empirical section, we turn to recent surveys, reports
   and analyses from reputable sources, such as the European Commission and
   other relevant organizations that provide insightful information on the
   digital behaviour of the citizens. By means of secondary data analysis,
   we look at relevant survey data tackling the fake news phenomenon. We
   aim at understanding what the public perceptions on fake news prevalence
   are, and what the current levels of trust in traditional and online
   media are. Furthermore, we pay particular attention to the digital
   behavior of the young generations, and we explore associated

Abstract = {{Objetive: This essay aims to ponder information, misinformation and
   disinformation as a means used by Anti-vaccine movements, addressing the
   production of their social effects in terms of materiality and
   institutionality of enunciations within information regimes.
   Methods: Bibliographic review focused on materiality and
   institutionality of enunciations, information, disinformation,
   information regimes, and anti-vaccine movements. Furthermore, consulting
   Brazilian governmental websites and legislation made reflections on the
   topics of this study viable.
   Results: The reflections point toward the materiality of misinformation
   and disinformation as a source or product of anti-vaccine discourses,
   which, at times, mimics resorts employed in public State policies, in a
   context in which previously eradicated immunopreventable diseases
   reappear, such as the case of measles in Brazil.
   Conclusions: The difficulty in distinguishing information from
   misinformation and disinformation constitutes a problem for the State,
   for Science, for public health entities, or for means of communication,
   and institutions of mediation, committed to information. The capitalized
   confirmation bias from anti-vaccine movements stands out as a means of
   resistance and/or confrontation to the control of the State.
   Vaccinations' side effects can be used out of context to reinforce the
   idea that ``every vaccine is harmful.{''} Science and the public power
   face the challenge of clarifying public opinion on the benefits and care
   to be taken concerning vaccines.}},

Abstract = {{Today's fragmented and digital media environment may create a fertile
   breeding ground for the uncontrolled spread of disinformation. Although
   previous research has investigated the effects of misinformation and
   corrective efforts, we know too little about the role of visuals in
   disinformation and fact checking. Against this backdrop, we conducted an
   online experiment with a diverse sample of U.S. citizens (N = 1,404) to
   investigate the credibility of textual versus multimodal
   (text-plus-visual) disinformation, and the effects of textual and
   multimodal fact checkers in refuting disinformation on school shootings
   and refugees. Our findings indicate that, irrespective of the source,
   multimodal disinformation is considered slightly more credible than
   textual disinformation. Fact checkers can help to overcome the potential
   harmful consequences of disinformation. We also found that fact checkers
   can overcome partisan and attitudinal filters - which points to the
   relevance of fact checking as a journalistic discipline.}},

Abstract = {{Disinformation does not always take the form of a fake news item, it
   also appears in much less evident formats which are subtly filtered into
   public opinion, thus making its detection more difficult. A method is
   proposed in this paper to address the study of ``widespread ``
   disinformation by combining social science methods with artificial
   intelligence and text mining. The case study chosen was the expression
   ``right of self-determination `` as a generator of disinformation within
   the context of the Catalan independence process. The main work
   hypothesis was that the (intentional or unintentional) confusion around
   the meaning and scope of this right has become widely extended within
   the population, generating negative emotions which favour social
   polarisation. The method utilised had three stages: (1) Description of
   the disinformation elements surrounding the term with the help of
   experts; (2) Detection of these elements within a corpus of tweets; (3)
   Identification of the emotions expressed in the corpus. The results show
   that the disinformation described by experts clearly dominates the
   conversation about ``self-determination `` on Twitter and is associated
   with a highly negative emotional load in which contempt, hatred, and
   frustration prevail.</p>}},

Abstract = {{We present an extensive study on disinformation, which is defined as
   information that is false and misleading and intentionally shared to
   cause harm. Through this work, we aim to answer the following questions:
   Can we automatically and accurately classify a news article as
   containing disinformation? What characteristics of disinformation
   differentiate it from other types of benign information? We conduct this
   study in the context of two significant events: the US elections of 2016
   and the 2020 COVID pandemic. We build a series of classifiers to (i)
   examine linguistic clues exhibited by different types of fake news
   articles, (ii) analyze ``clickbaityness{''} of disinformation headlines,
   and (iii) finally, perform fine-grained, veracity-based article
   classification through a natural language inference (NLI) module for
   automated disinformation verification; this utilizes a manually curated
   set of evidence sources. For the latter, we built a new dataset that is
   annotated with generic, veracity-based labels and ground truth evidence
   supporting each label. The veracity labels were formulated based on
   examining standards used by reputable fact-checking organizations. We
   show that disinformation derives features from both propaganda and
   mainstream news, making it more challenging to detect. However, there is
   significant potential for automating the fact-checking process to
   incorporate the degree of veracity. We provide error analysis that
   illustrates the challenges involved in the automated fact-checking task
   and identifies factors that may improve this process in future work.
   Finally, we also describe the implementation of a web app that extracts
   important entities and actions from a given article and searches the web
   to gather evidence from credible sources. The evidence articles are then
   used to generate a veracity label that can assist manual fact-checkers
   engaged in combating disinformation.}},

   Although the term `misinformation' has been generalized in media and
   scholarly work, there is a fundamental difference between how
   misinformation impacts society, compared to more strategically planned
   disinformation attacks. In this study we explore the ideological
   constructs of citizens towards acceptance or rejection of disinformation
   during the heightened time of a COVID-19 global health crisis. Our
   analysis follows two specific disinformation propagandas evaluated
   through social network analysis of Twitter data in addition to

Abstract = {{The article discusses some points about the current state of
   disinformation in information processes, especially in the media
   context. Globalization and its constant movement, of a socially
   asymmetrical and separatist nature, drives collective discrepancies and
   opens the way for what it has been called collective
   ``imbecilization.{''} At this juncture, the wide-open phenomenon of
   disinformation in society results in excessive manipulation and
   distortion of information. Therefore, this discussion presents, through
   a bibliographic survey, the urgency of information literacy development
   - whose assumption consists of lifelong learning - aimed at the
   informational dysfunction present in the postmodern societies. Such
   development is denoted as a form of remediation and not the absolute
   eradication of the problem, since it is essential to preserve critical
   and self-critical thinking in order to reduce and control the quality of
   the information consumed and shared. It is then asserted that efforts to
   combat the so-called imbecilization and informational dysfunction need
   to occur in different spheres of social life, and involve the
   multidisciplinary fusion of technology, education, culture, economics
   and politics.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Disinformation is a current phenomenon. Fake news stories
   have the potential to go viral and this poses new risks for the
   reputation of organisations. This study seeks to identify the types of
   organisations (public institutions, political parties and companies)
   that have been affected the most by fake news in Spain and to identify
   the most frequently spread false rumours. Methods: The study adopts a
   descriptive approach based on the content analysis of the fake news
   collected, over a 3-month period, by Maldito Bulo, an independent
   journalistic platform focused on the control of disinformation and
   public discourse through fact-checking and data journalism techniques.
   Results and conclusions: The results confirm that more than half of the
   sample of fake news target organisations and seek to affect mainly the
   reputation of public institutions, followed by companies and political
   parties. 31\% of the fake news related to organisations referred to
   individuals associated to them.}},

Abstract = {{The paper presents a qualitative study of fake news on Polish-language
   internet media that seeks to arrive at their thematic classification in
   order to identify areas particularly vulnerable to disinformation in
   Poland. Fake news examples from 2019 were selected using popular Polish
   fact-checking sites (N = 192) and subjected to textual analysis and
   coding procedure to establish the thematic categories and specific
   topics most often encountered in this type of disinformation, with the
   following thematic categories identified in the process: political and
   economic; social; gossip/rumour; extreme; pseudo-scientific; worldview;
   historical; and commercial. The study culminates in a critical
   interpretation of results and discussion of the phenomenon in its Polish
   and international contexts. Among discussed conclusions is the dominance
   of content related to the government, Catholic Church, and LGBT issues
   in the Polish context, as well as the longevity of health-based fake
   news, especially anti-vaccination content, that points to the global
   impact of fake news and calls for action to prevent its spread.}},

Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The truth value of any new piece of information is not only investigated
   by media platforms, but also debated intensely on internet forums. Forum
   users are fighting back against misinformation, by informally flagging
   suspicious posts as false or misleading in their comments. We propose
   extracting posts informally flagged by Reddit users as a means to narrow
   down the list of potential instances of disinformation. To identify
   these flags, we built a dictionary enhanced with part of speech tags and
   dependency parsing to filter out specific phrases. Our rule-based
   approach performs similarly to machine learning models, but offers more
   transparency and interactivity. Posts matched by our technique are
   presented in a publicly accessible, daily updated, and customizable
   dashboard. This paper offers a descriptive analysis of which topics,
   venues, and time periods were linked to perceived misinformation in the
   first half of 2020, and compares user flagged sources with an external
   dataset of unreliable news websites. Using this method can help
   researchers understand how truth and falsehood are perceived in the
   subreddit communities, and to identify new false narratives before they
   spread through the larger population.}},

Journal = {{PROFESIONAL DE LA INFORMACION}},

Month = {{JUL-AUG}},
Abstract = {{Disinformation is a communicative phenomenon that frequently feeds on
   political or electoral topics, as well as other aspects of our reality.
   This research takes as a case study the coverage given by the Spanish
   digital media to a hoax broadcast during the Filomena storm in 2021 that
   insisted that the snow was plastic. The purpose of this work is to
   analyze the instrumentalization of fake information as an expression of
   the information media crisis in the current context of disinformation.
   We set out four specific objectives: (SO1) to study the spread of the
   hoax through the media, (SO2) to analyze the construction of headlines
   in the news pieces, (SO3) to investigate the treatment of the hoax in
   the content of the pieces, and (SO4) to analyze the sources used in the
   pieces. To reflect on this phenomenon, we propose a three-dimensional
   model (structural, economic, and pragmatic) aimed at clarifying the
   relationship between the logic of the spread of hoaxes on the Internet
   and the role played by traditional media in their diffusion. The
   methodology used combines workflow techniques of digital methods with
   quantitative and content analyses. The results reveal the appropriation
   of certain communication strategies by digital newspapers aimed at
   obtaining visits. We conclude that the Spanish media, by adapting to the
   dynamics of disinformation irresponsibly encouraged by the attention
   economy, subscribe to and reinforce the crisis of credibility faced by
   the media ecosystem.}},

   more on emotions, feelings and beliefs rather than on objective facts.
   It shows the results of the research Media Literacy Index 2018 which
   represent 35 European countries and the tendency of their citizens to
   believe disinformation which is closely connected with level of media

Title = {{De-platforming disinformation: conspiracy theories and their control}},
Journal = {{INFORMATION COMMUNICATION \& SOCIETY}},
Abstract = {{Informed by two case studies of de-platforming interventions performed
   by Facebook against two high profile conspiracy theorists who had been
   messaging about Covid-19, this article investigates how de-platforming
   functions as an instrument of social control, illuminating the intended
   and unintended effects it induces. To help interpret the patterns in the
   data, two novel conceptual innovations are introduced. The concept of
   `minion accounts' captures how following a de-platforming intervention,
   a series of secondary accounts are set up to continue the mission. Such
   accounts are part of a wider retinue of `re-platforming' behaviours.
   Overall, the empirical evidence reviewed suggests that whilst
   de-platforming can constrain transmission of conspiratorial
   disinformation, it does not eradicate it.}},

Abstract = {{The present investigation aims to analyse the flow of disinformation in
   the context of the covid-19 pandemic in Brazil. The analysis is
   developed from a quantitative approach, using documental analysis. The
   sample consists of publications that circulated on social media between
   January and May 2020. In this period, a political crisis was added to
   the public health crisis in the country, which highlights the discussion
   of the main themes in the public debate. The results demonstrate that
   the topic ``coronavirus{''} grows progressively over the months
   analysed. However, there are significant changes in the frameworks of
   the theme, which gradually come to reflect the political dispute created
   around the pandemic crisis.}},

Journal = {{COMPUTERS IN HUMAN BEHAVIOR}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{116}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{A growing literature is emerging on the believability and spread of
   disinformation, such as fake news, over social networks. However, little
   is known about the degree to which malicious actors can use social media
   to covertly affect behavior with disinformation. A lab-based randomized
   controlled experiment was conducted with 233 undergraduate students to
   investigate the behavioral effects of fake news. It was found that even
   short (under 5-min) exposure to fake news was able to significantly
   modify the unconscious behavior of individuals. This paper provides
   initial evidence that fake news can be used to covertly modify behavior,
   it argues that current approaches to mitigating fake news, and
   disinformation in general, are insufficient to protect social media
   users from this threat, and it highlights the implications of this for
   democracy. It raises the need for an urgent cross-sectoral effort to
   investigate, protect against, and mitigate the risks of covert,
   widespread and decentralized behavior modification over online social
   networks.}},

Journal = {{EUROPEAN MANAGEMENT JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{38}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{7-18}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The ubiquity of social media has created both opportunities and
   challenges for businesses and societies. For product brands, ideas, or
   campaigns to gain traction on social media platforms, they need to
   capture attention. This is often accomplished by creating and
   disseminating compelling information, even disinformation, on these
   platforms. Strategies that drive this attention economy are often not
   obvious. The monetization of disinformation is explored here through a
   case study on genetically modified organisms (GMOs) and the analysis of
   a dataset of 94,993 unique online articles. When combined these methods
   allow for the evaluation and exploration of various tactics that
   contribute to the evolving GMO narrative and their potential application
   to other topics. Preliminary results suggest that a small group of
   alternative health and pro-conspiracy sites received more total
   engagements on social media than sites commonly regarded as media
   outlets on the topic of GMOs. Other externalities observed include
   continued social and political controversy that surround the GMO topic
   as well as the growth of additional product and marketing approaches
   such as ``non-GMO{''} verification. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by

   blurs distinctions between fact and fiction through interlinks among

Abstract = {{Fact-checking alliances emerged worldwide to debunk political
   disinformation in electoral contexts because of social concerns related
   to information authenticity. This study, thus, included the Latin
   American context in fact-checking journalism studies as a journalistic
   practice to fight political disinformation. Through analyzing RedCheq,
   the first fact-checking journalism alliance in an electoral regional
   context led by Colombiacheck, 11 in-depth interviews were conducted to
   identify the perceptions of regional fact-checkers regarding the
   usefulness of this journalistic practice, its achievements, and the key
   aspects for incorporating fact-checking into the regional media
   ecosystem. The study results revealed that RedCheq achieved the goal of
   fighting disinformation, and that fact-checking developed as
   transformational leverage for the regional media. Regional journalists
   perceived fact-checking as an element that restores credibility and
   social trust in regional media as the epistemology of this journalistic
   practice neglects the power pressure and dissemination of official
   narratives. Finally, this study highlighted how fact-checking journalism
   contributes to the democratic quality and civic empowerment in silenced
   and polarized environments. In addition, it discussed the need to expand
   fact-checking journalism's coverage to new geographical areas and
   improve journalists' professional competencies and training, thereby
   enabling them to function as using verification tools based on regional
   journalists' requirements.}},

Pages = {{251-263}},
Abstract = {{As democracy-building tools, fact-checking platforms serve as critical
   interventions in the fight against disinformation and polarization in
   the public sphere. The Duke Reporters' Lab notes that there are 290
   active fact-checking sites in 83 countries, including a wide range of
   initiatives in Latin America and Spain. These regions share major
   challenges such as limited journalistic autonomy, difficulties of
   accessing public data, politicization of the media, and the growing
   impact of disinformation. This research expands upon the findings
   presented in previous literature to gain further insight into the
   standards, values, and underlying practices embedded in Spanish and
   Latin American projects while identifying the specific challenges that
   these organizations face. In-depth interviews were conducted with
   decision-makers of the following independent platforms: Chequeado
   (Argentina), UYCheck (Uruguay), Maldita.es and Newtral (Spain), Fact
   Checking (Chile), Agencia Lupa (Brazil), Ecuador Chequea (Ecuador), and
   ColombiaCheck (Colombia). This qualitative approach offers nuanced data
   on the volume and frequency of checks, procedures, dissemination
   tactics, and the perceived role of the public. Despite relying on small
   teams, the examined outlets' capacity to verify facts is noteworthy.
   Inspired by best practices in the US and Europe and the model
   established by Chequeado, all the sites considered employ robust
   methodologies while leveraging the power of digital tools and audience
   participation. Interviewees identified three core challenges in
   fact-checking practice: difficulties in accessing public data, limited
   resources, and the need to reach wider audiences. Starting from these
   results, the article discusses the ways in which fact-checking
   operations could be strengthened.}},

Abstract = {{Misleading information is an emerging cyber risk. It includes
   misinformation, disinformation, and fake news. Digital transformation
   and COVID-19 have exacerbated it. While there has been much discussion
   about the effects of misinformation, disinformation, and fake news on
   the political process, the consequences of misleading information on
   businesses have been far less, and it can be argued insufficiently,
   examined. The article offers a primer on misleading information and
   cyber risks aimed at business executives and leaders across an array of
   industries, organizations, and nations. Misleading information can have
   a profound effect on business. I analyze different misleading
   information types and identify associated cyber risks to help businesses
   think about these emerging threats. I examine in general the cyber risk
   posed by misleading information on business, and I explore in more
   detail the impact on healthcare, media, financial markets, and elections
   and geopolitical risks. Finally, I offer a set of practical
   recommendations for organizations to respond to these new challenges and
   to manage risks. (c) 2021 Kelley School of Business, Indiana University.

   (WARDLE; DERAKHSHAN, 2017) during the Covid-19 pandemic. Considering
   factors related to the rise of these platforms and their business models
   (MOROZOV, 2018), we have conducted a case study based on a documentary
   research of the policies and measures announced, problematizing these
   actions based on the notion of algorithmic consensus and digital solving
   (MOROZOV, 2018, 2020). From the identification of the reactive action,
   we conclude that strengthening a relationship of dependence with these
   companies for this fight is insufficient and dangerous.}},

Abstract = {{The process of fast decision-making in the uncertainty situation in
   scientific literature after works by D. Kanemann, A. Tversky and R.
   Thaler is traditionally described by illogicality and lack of use of
   rational decision-making mechanisms. But today an issue of the impact of
   a logical form of language (disinformation, logical probability and
   logical contradiction) on decision-making has not been studied yet. In
   this study the interrelation between the size of semantic disinformation
   of language and acceptance of fast and slow decisions becomes apparent.
   To that end, two experiments were carried out. In the first experiment
   there analyzed the influence of size of semantic disinformation at fast
   decision-making. In the second experiment there analyzed the influence
   of semantic disinformation at slow decision-making. Additionally
   correlation analysis of characteristics of age, logical competence, time
   of decision-making and size of semantic disinformation is carried out.
   In the study we have established: 1) inefficiency of level of logical
   competence and mechanisms of classical rationality at fast
   decision-making; 2) positive correlation of time of the decision and
   level of logical competence of subjects in the process of slow
   decision-making.}},

Title = {{Summary Judicial Proceedings as a Measure for Electoral Disinformation:
   Defining the European Standard}},
Journal = {{GERMAN LAW JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{4}},

Abstract = {{Electoral disinformation has become one of the most challenging problems
   for democratic states. All of them are facing the phenomenon of - both
   online and offline - dissemination of false information during
   pre-electoral period, which is harmful for individual and collective
   rights. As a consequence, some European countries adopted special
   measures, including summary judicial proceedings in order to declare
   that information or materials used in electioneering are false and to
   prohibit its further dissemination. There are already three rulings of
   the ECtHR concerning this expeditious judicial examination provided in
   the Polish law. In December 2018 France passed complex regulation
   against manipulation of information that include similar mechanisms.
   This article, basing on the ECtHR's case law and some national
   experiences, attempts to define the minimal European standard for
   measures targeted at electoral disinformation, especially judicial
   summary proceeding. It contains the analysis of the notion of electoral
   disinformation, defines the state's positive obligations in this sphere,
   and indicates mayor challenges for the legal framework. The principal
   argument is that summary judicial proceedings - if adequately designed -
   cannot be questioned from the Convention standpoint and provide a
   partial solution to the problem of electoral disinformation.}},

Abstract = {{YouTube, since its inception in 2005, has grown to become largest online
   video sharing website. It's massive user-base uploads videos and
   generates discussion by commenting on these videos. Lately, YouTube,
   akin to other social media sites, has become a vehicle for spreading
   fake news, propaganda, conspiracy theories, and radicalizing content.
   However, lack ineffective image and video processing techniques has
   hindered research on YouTube. In this paper, we advocate the use of
   metadata in identifying such malicious behaviors. Specifically, we
   analyze metadata of videos (e.g., comments, commenters) to study a
   channel on YouTube that was pushing content promoting conspiracy
   theories regarding World War III. Identifying signals that could be used
   to detect such deviant content (e.g., videos, comments) can help in
   stemming the spread of disinformation. We collected over 4,145 videos
   along with 16,493 comments from YouTube. We analyze user engagement to
   assess the reach of the channel and apply social network analysis
   techniques to identify inorganic behaviors.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose The purpose of this paper is to treat disinformation and
   misinformation (intentionally deceptive and unintentionally inaccurate
   misleading information, respectively) as a socio-cultural
   technology-enabled epidemic in digital news, propagated via social
   media. Design/methodology/approach The proposed disinformation and
   misinformation triangle is a conceptual model that identifies the three
   minimal causal factors occurring simultaneously to facilitate the spread
   of the epidemic at the societal level. Findings Following the
   epidemiological disease triangle model, the three interacting causal
   factors are translated into the digital news context: the virulent
   pathogens are falsifications, clickbait, satirical ``fakes{''} and other
   deceptive or misleading news content; the susceptible hosts are
   information-overloaded, time-pressed news readers lacking media literacy
   skills; and the conducive environments are polluted poorly regulated
   social media platforms that propagate and encourage the spread of
   various ``fakes.{''} Originality/value The three types of interventions
   - automation, education and regulation - are proposed as a set of
   holistic measures to reveal, and potentially control, predict and
   prevent further proliferation of the epidemic. Partial automated
   solutions with natural language processing, machine learning and various
   automated detection techniques are currently available, as exemplified
   here briefly. Automated solutions assist (but not replace) human
   judgments about whether news is truthful and credible. Information
   literacy efforts require further in-depth understanding of the
   phenomenon and interdisciplinary collaboration outside of the
   traditional library and information science, incorporating media
   studies, journalism, interpersonal psychology and communication
   perspectives.}},

Abstract = {{The past decade saw a changing political landscape in Southeast Asia.
   From a promising turn towards democracy, marked by episodes of
   backsliding and authoritarian tendencies, and recently threats of
   democratic regression and political decay in most parts of the region,
   have dominated current discourse. Central to these changes is the
   evolution of information and communications technology, and the ubiquity
   of social media platforms as sources of news and information, as well as
   shaping public opinion. The paper looks into three cases in Southeast
   Asia: online hate along ethnic lines in Myanmar; Duterte populism and
   broad forms of disinformation in the Philippines; and increasing fake
   news and online radical Islamism in Indonesia. Trends, common areas of
   concern, and possible patterns would be gleaned from the case studies;
   and from there, distil prospects for engagement and better approaches
   against the growing concern for disinformation in the region. The
   research recommends that a more concerted and inclusive regional
   approach would help turn the tide against an increasingly deceived
   public.}},

   COVID-19 Disinformation in French-Speaking Regions}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH}},
Year = {{2021}},

Abstract = {{Digital communication technology has created a world in which media are
   capable of crossing national boundaries as never before. As a result,
   language is increasingly the salient category determining individuals'
   media consumption. Today, a single social media post can travel around
   the world, reaching anyone who speaks its language. This poses
   significant challenges to combatting the spread of disinformation, as an
   ever-growing pool of disinformation purveyors reach audiences larger
   than ever before. This dynamic is complicated, however, by the diversity
   of audience interpretations of message content within a particular
   language group. Both across and within national boundaries, a single
   message may be subject to a variety of interpretations depending on the
   cultural experiences and identities of its recipients. This study
   explores that dynamic through analysis of French language anti-vaccine
   and COVID-denialist disinformation. Using qualitative coding
   methodology, a team of researchers empirically identify common and
   far-reaching patterns of Francophone COVID disinformation narratives and
   rhetoric. These narratives and rhetorics are then subjected to
   hermeneutic close reading to determine likely variations in their
   reception across different French-speaking cultures. Data were gathered
   and analyzed between the dates of 24 March 2021 and 27 April 2021.
   Results of this study indicate the need for awareness on the part of
   public health officials combatting COVID disinformation online, for both
   the transnational reach of disinformation targeting speakers of a single
   language and for variations in meaning and salience across cultures
   within that language group.}},

Abstract = {{In this article, we analyze the spread of political disinformation in
   events of discursive struggles on Twitter, during the 2018 presidential
   election in Brazil. These were disputes for the hegemonic narrative
   between two stories based on opposed hashtags: one based on news from
   mainstream media and the other, based on disinformation, mostly from
   hyperpartisan outlets. Our goal was to understand how hyperpartisan
   outlets created and shaped these discursive struggles and the strategies
   used to spread disinformation to create an ``alternative narrative{''}
   to the facts. Our case study is focused on two discursive struggles, for
   which we will use critical discourse analysis and social network
   analysis. Our findings suggest that (1) the structure of the hashtag
   wars was very polarized and right-wing groups had higher exposure to
   hyperpartisan content and disinformation, while traditional media
   discourse circulates more among other different ideological clusters;
   (2) rightwing hyperpartisan media mostly used biased framing and
   polarized ideological discourse structure as manipulative strategies to
   reframe the events and create a counter-narrative (and thus, to create
   the dispute); and (3) opinion leaders were major spreaders of
   disinformation among far-right users, as they reinforced hyperpartisan
   content and became key actors in the discursive struggles (and thus,
   reinforced the dispute).}},

Abstract = {{Misinformation and disinformation, often in the form of fake news
   disseminated on social media, are proliferating in the post-truth era,
   with profound implications for public and policy discourse, political
   accountability and integrity, elections and governance. The United
   States is grappling with an information landscape eroded by deeply
   flawed information from a variety of sources, including Russian efforts
   to undermine its recent presidential election. As it struggles with
   these problems, the U.S. must also decide if and how to deploy political
   disinformation. U.S. foreign policy has made significant use of
   disinformation to influence politics and elections, and as emerging
   technologies allow new means of producing, disseminating, and amplifying
   disinformation, American presidents, security officials, and covert
   operators will weigh their use and usefulness. These technologies will
   also create new, largely unknown effects, the normative, practical, and
   governance implications of which must be scrutinized. Despite the
   attention now focused on disinformation, this angle has received
   inadequate consideration. This article argues that in rapidly shifting
   technological and political landscapes, disinformation programs require
   the highest possible degree of examination and accountability. Congress;
   the electorate; media; and researchers must engage in the public
   conversation to ensure that American democratic and ethical values
   inform U.S. policy.}},

   verification media entities accredited by the International

   The results show that the most commonly used formats were image and
   video, that disinformation was most often based on taking information
   out of context and deception, and that the source could not be
   identified. The most shared characteristics associated otherness with
   receiving aid, violence and illegal immigration. The most commonly used
   images were photographs, which mostly showed people in a general manner
   (not individually). Despite this, disinformation was not generated by
   manipulating images, but by inserting text over images. The use of
   supposed screenshots to create fictitious references or take truthful
   screenshots out of context was also notable.}},

   a quantitative analysis of 472 publications shared in ten groups. The
   access to this data was possible thanks to the cooperation of citizens

   findings show that image with text still corresponds to the most

   larger wave of information that disagrees with the disinformation and
   are less prevalent in relative terms. The impact of Russian
   state-controlled news outlets-which are frequent sources of pro-Kremlin
   disinformation-is concentrated in one, highly popular news outlet, RT.
   The few, popular Russian news media have to compete with many popular
   Western media outlets. As a result, the combined impact of Russian
   state-controlled outlets is relatively low when comparing to its Western

   APPROACHES USED IN THE EU AND ITS MEMBER STATE LITHUANIA}},
Journal = {{BALTIC REGION}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{12}},

Pages = {{53-67}},
Abstract = {{This study analyses EU and Lithuanian documents on countering
   disinformation/fake news to present the plurality of the Union's
   approaches to ensuring resilience. Currently, there are three approaches
   to the problem in the EU. The first one, used by the European
   Commission, is the recognition of citizens' right to information as well
   as of the need to promote critical thinking and information literacy.
   This approach fits into the adaptive paradigm of action in the
   information space and the concept of autopoietic resilience. The second
   approach, taken by the European External Action Service, is to expose
   fake news and the media spreading it. In combining adaptive and
   paternalistic paradigms of action in the information space, this
   approach employs a more static interpretation of resilience. Lithuania
   has adopted a third approach, which is dominated by the paternalistic
   paradigm and homeostatic resilience. This approach consists of the state
   isolating citizens from certain information. Thus, the popular use of
   the term `resilience' in the EU disguises the plurality of approaches to
   both disinformation and resilience itself. Theoretically, this study
   draws on the concept of resilience and paradigms for countering

Abstract = {{Objective: It describes and analyzes the theoretical-practical
   incidences of misinformation, disinformation, and malinformation,
   including but not limited to the Information Science framework. Besides,
   it aims to outline an understanding of these three concepts based on 16
   arrangements interconnected according to their intentionality.
   Methods: To build discourses and descriptions of the phenomenon of
   misinformation and its derivations, we applied the hermeneutical,
   rhetorical, and phenomenological principles of intentionality as our
   work methods.
   Results: As a result, we present some theoretical incidences to clarify
   these three concepts, in addition to outlining and characterizing,
   according to the intentionality, 16 mis-, dis-, mal- information
   arrangements associated with these three concepts: bias, propaganda,
   retracted papers, conspiracy theories, misleading representation in
   maps, charts and graphics, fake news, clickbait, hoax, satire or parody,
   imposter website, fake reviews, phishing, filter bubbles, and echo
   chambers.
   Conclusions: We highlight that the complexity that permeates the various
   fields in the present situation is due to the difficulty of reaching a
   consensus on the semantic definition of the concepts of information,
   misinformation, and its disambiguations since these concepts have
   various properties.}},

   Why we need an eHealth literacy revolution}},
Journal = {{HUMAN VACCINES \& IMMUNOTHERAPEUTICS}},
Abstract = {{The quality of online health information is cause for concern in
   general, and the spread of mis/disinformation on the benefits and risks
   of vaccines has certainly been fueling vaccine hesitancy. In the wake of
   the COVID-19 pandemic, we have entered an era of unprecedented
   ``infodemic.{''} There has never been a more urgent time to address the
   long-standing question of how to overcome the deleterious influence of
   exposure to online mis/disinformation on vaccine uptake. eHealth
   literacy, a skill set including media literacy, is key to navigating the
   web in search for health information and processing the one encountered
   through social media. Studies assessing the impact of increasing eHealth
   literacy on behavioral attitudes and health outcomes in the general
   population are relatively scarce to date. Yet for many reasons,
   leveraging eHealth literacy skills, and more specifically, media
   literacy, could be of great value to help mitigate the detrimental
   effects of erroneous information on vaccination decision-making. In this
   paper, we make the case that eHealth and media literacies should be
   viewed as fundamental skills that have the potential to empower citizens
   to better recognize online mis/disinformation and make informed
   decisions about vaccination as any other health matters.}},

Abstract = {{Disinformation is proliferating on the internet, and platforms are
   responding by attaching warnings to content. There is little evidence,
   however, that these warnings help users identify or avoid
   disinformation. In this work, we adapt methods and results from the
   information security warning literature in order to design and evaluate
   effective disinformation warnings.
   In an initial laboratory study, we used a simulated search task to
   examine contextual and interstitial disinformation warning designs. We
   found that users routinely ignore contextual warnings, but users notice
   interstitial warnings-and respond by seeking information from
   alternative sources.
   We then conducted a follow-on crowdworker study with eight interstitial
   warning designs. We confirmed a significant impact on user
   information-seeking behavior, and we found that a warning's design could
   effectively inform users or convey a risk of harm. We also found,
   however, that neither user comprehension nor fear of harm moderated
   behavioral effects.
   Our work provides evidence that disinformation warnings can-when
   designed well-help users identify and avoid disinformation. We show a
   path forward for designing effective warnings, and we contribute
   repeatable methods for evaluating behavioral effects. We also surface a
   possible dilemma: disinformation warnings might be able to inform users
   and guide behavior, but the behavioral effects might result from user
   experience friction, not informed decision making.}},

   how European leaders are pushed in directions contrary to continental

   favourability of Europeans towards Russia as a result of soft power
   campaigns during the Covid-19 outbreak in Spring 2020 - in what we

Title = {{Platform values and democratic elections: How can the law regulate
   digital disinformation?}},
Journal = {{COMPUTER LAW \& SECURITY REVIEW}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{36}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{This article examines how governments can regulate the values of social
   media companies that themselves regulate disinformation spread on their
   own platforms. We use disinformation' to refer to motivated faking of
   news. We examine the effects that dis- information initiatives (many
   based on automated decision-making systems using Artificial Intelligence
   {[}AI] to cope with the scale of content being shared) have on freedom
   of expression, media pluralism and the exercise of democracy, from the
   wider lens of tackling illegal content online and concerns to request
   proactive (automated) measures of online intermediaries. We particularly
   focus on the responses of the member states and in-stitutions of the
   European Union. In Section 1, we argue that the apparent significance of
   the threat has led many governments to legislate despite this lack of
   evidence, with over 40 national laws to combat disinformation chronicled
   by March 2019. Which types of regulation are proposed, which actors are
   targeted, and who is making these regulations? Regulating fake news
   should not fall solely on national governments or supranational bodies
   like the European Union. Neither should the companies be responsible for
   regulating themselves. Instead, we favour co-regulation. Co-regulation
   means that the companies develop - individually or collectively -
   mechanisms to regulate their own users, which in turn must be approved
   by democratically legitimate state regulators or legislatures, who also
   monitor their effectiveness. In Section 2, we explain the current EU use
   of Codes of Conduct. In Section 3, we then explain the relatively novel
   idea that social media content regulation, and specifically
   disinformation, can be dealt with by deploying AI at massive scale. It
   is necessary to deal with this technological issue in order to explain
   the wider content of co-regulatory policy options, which we explain and
   for which we argue in Section 4. In Section 5 we explain what this means
   for technology regulation generally, and the socio-economic calculus in
   this policy field. (C) 2019 Chris Marsden, Trisha Meyer, Ian Brown.

Abstract = {{This study uses a Critical Race Digital Literacy framework to examine

   disinformation campaign's Facebook profile targeting African Americans
   considerably more challenging. In addition, though 34\% recognized a
   video screenshot arguing that building a wall at the southern border is
   humane as racist, participants had difficulty combining this knowledge

   groups, these findings highlight the need for more interventions to
   enhance competencies around critically evaluating race-related materials

Abstract = {{This article explores audience perceptions of different types of
   disinformation, and the actions that users take to combat them, in three
   Spanish-speaking countries: Argentina, Chile, and Spain. Quantitative
   data from the Digital News Report (2018 and 2019), based on a survey of
   more than 2000 digital users from each country was used for the
   analysis. Results show remarkable similarities among the three
   countries, and how digital users identically ranked the types of
   problematic information that concerned them most. Survey participants
   were most concerned by stories where facts are spun or twisted to push a
   particular agenda, followed by, those that are completely made up for
   political or commercial reasons, and finally, they were least concerned
   by poor journalism (factual mistakes, dumbed-down stories, misleading
   headlines/clickbait). A general index of ``Concern about
   disinformation{''} was constructed using several sociodemographic
   variables that might influence the perception. It showed that the
   phenomenon is higher among women, older users, those particularly
   interested in political news, and among left-wingers. Several measures
   are employed by users to avoid disinformation, such as checking a number
   of different sources to see whether a news story is reported in the same
   way, relying on the reputation of the news company, and/or deciding not
   to share a news story due to doubts regarding its accuracy. This article
   concludes that the perceived relevance of different types of problematic
   information, and preventive actions, are not homogeneous among different
   population segments.}},

Pages = {{169-183}},
Abstract = {{The spread of fake news on Covid19 is causing public unrest and
   suspicion among citizens which is a challenge for countries facing the
   pandemic. The misinformation or disinformation which stems from
   uncertainties, unrest, and anxiety because of movement control order
   procedures, financial and economic hardship caused wrong information to
   spread like fire. Called as `info-demic', it becomes a second source of
   virulent information that requires arresting just like the pandemic
   itself. Controlling fake news in the time of pandemic is a daunting
   problem that slaps Internet regulation at its face. On the Internet,
   lies spreads faster than truth and correcting misinformation means
   tonnes of work. This paper examines Internet self- and co-regulatory
   approaches in selected jurisdictions to reduce the impact of fake news
   on governments, industry, and private actors. In applying content
   analysis as a qualitative research method, the first section analysed
   specific legislations enacted by parliaments to criminalise the acts of
   disseminating and publishing fake news. The second section examines
   legislative and administrative efforts to impose civil and criminal
   liability on platform providers to monitor online content. The final
   section analysed self-regulatory efforts to introduce online
   fact-checking portals and awareness campaigns. This paper argues that
   Internet self-regulation scheme in Malaysia is not bringing the desired
   result in the scope of maintaining peace and security of the nation.
   Considering how dangerous disinformation can cause to the society, more
   so in global emergency like the present Covid19 pandemic, it is
   submitted that Internet co-regulation is more suitable if the social,
   moral and cultural fabric of the society is to be maintained.}},

Abstract = {{Democracy is often used as shorthand for liberal democracy. Despite such
   casual conflation, the two concepts remain importantly distinct. I argue
   that democracy unfettered by the constraints of liberal institutions and
   commitments gives rise to the proliferation of disinformation and to
   xenophobic populism. I draw upon Plato and the democracy of ancient
   Athens to illustrate the history of association between disinformation
   and democracy. Moving on to our more contemporary treatments of
   liberalism, specifically to the ideal theory of John Rawls, I show that
   in order to address disinformation and the reactionary politics in which
   it thrives, we must attend to a robust defense of liberalism against
   non-liberal and illiberal democracy. (C) Studia Humanitatis -

   news spreading on Twitter}},
Journal = {{EPJ DATA SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{DEC 23}},
Abstract = {{We tackle the problem of classifying news articles pertaining to
   disinformation vs mainstream news by solely inspecting their diffusion
   mechanisms on Twitter. This approach is inherently simple compared to
   existing text-based approaches, as it allows to by-pass the multiple
   levels of complexity which are found in news content (e.g. grammar,
   syntax, style). As we employ a multi-layer representation of Twitter
   diffusion networks where each layer describes one single type of
   interaction (tweet, retweet, mention, etc.), we quantify the advantage
   of separating the layers with respect to an aggregated approach and
   assess the impact of each layer on the classification. Experimental
   results with two large-scale datasets, corresponding to diffusion
   cascades of news shared respectively in the United States and Italy,
   show that a simple Logistic Regression model is able to classify
   disinformation vs mainstream networks with high accuracy (AUROC up to
   94\%). We also highlight differences in the sharing patterns of the two
   news domains which appear to be common in the two countries. We believe
   that our network-based approach provides useful insights which pave the
   way to the future development of a system to detect misleading and
   harmful information spreading on social media.}},

Journal = {{ELECTION LAW JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{214-239}},
Month = {{JUN 1}},
Abstract = {{Election interference is a problem in digitized elections around the
   world. Given East and Southeast Asia's dense social network, electoral
   integrity is a growing concern. Yet, few studies focus on this region's
   regulatory approaches to data-driven campaigns or disinformation threat.
   This article addresses this by proposing an electoral management digital
   readiness (EMDR) index to compare the readiness of the ten electoral
   management bodies (EMBs) in East and Southeast Asia to respond to
   digital disruptions. The aim is to take stock of the new and amended
   laws and provide a composite index based on four key criteria, namely,
   the (1) type of electoral management model; (2) presence of specific or
   new regulations governing online campaign and disinformation; (3)
   confidence in the rule of law; and (4) technological readiness of the
   digital economy. Based on available legal statutes and cross-country
   indicators, this study finds the EMBs in Singapore, South Korea, Japan,
   Taiwan, and Thailand to have a high level of digital readiness;
   Malaysia, the Philippines, and Indonesia to have a medium level; and
   Cambodia and Myanmar to have a low level. A key finding is that a
   multi-pronged regulatory approach that involves different stakeholders
   is necessary to improve the timeliness of fact-checking and removal of
   malicious content, rather than relying on state-led initiatives to
   improve online electoral governance.}},

Abstract = {{Most academic papers on the disinformation examine the current form of

   one of the main work methods of 1.st Administration of the National

   Czechoslovakia, and its implementation of the so-called active measures.
   The text focused mostly on concrete, so far unpublished, active
   measures, focusing in particular on operations carried out in the
   interest of cooperation between the former services of the former
   Eastern Bloc. Presented were mainly operations whose target was the
   ``main enemy{''}, the United States and NATO, and the operations against
   its allies. The study was based on the assumption that, with the
   apparent personnel continuity within the Russian secret services, there
   was a continuity of thinking, and thus also a continuity of intelligence
   activity approaches.The results confirmed this assumption and
   demonstrated the actual continuity of disinformation phenomenon, which
   only uses new technologies today, yet combined with former
   approaches.Therefore, the use of available archival documents should not
   be ignored in nowadays recognition and combat of the phenomenon of
   misinformation. Comparative archival approach can be used today in
   education and information to improve safety.}},

   of disinformation. Posing as a Black woman concerned with social justice

Title = {{Disinformation and media literacy from the institutions: the decalogues
   against fake news}},
Journal = {{REVISTA INTERNACIONAL DE RELACIONES PUBLICAS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{20}},
Pages = {{111-134}},

Abstract = {{In an environment characterized by infoxication, the speed and immediacy
   of information circulation, the emotionality of the messages, the
   virality, the horizontality in the content production, and the lack of
   trust in institutions and media, we consider vital the role that
   institutions play through their institutional advertising to deal with
   misinformation. For this reason, our research aims to establish whether
   there is coherence between the institutional visual campaigns, about
   fake news during Covid-19 and the recommendations of national and
   international bodies, such as the European Commission, UNESCO and the
   WHO. Based on the importance that these organizations give to the
   contextualization and consequences of the problem, we analyzed a
   representative sample of 20 visual resources through content analysis
   and discursive analysis to assess whether the approach of these
   campaigns is appropiate. We also studied the virality of the information
   through an analysis of the content diffusion on Twitter. Our results
   indicated an insufficient number of posters and decalogues, along with
   their limitation in dealing with disinformation. First of all, we
   observed a lack of coordination in the framing of the problem, because
   despite the detection mechanisms (contrast, source analysis, medium) are
   specified, and the non-viralization / dissemination is urged,
   intentionality and repercussion are directly and indirectly ignored. A
   60\% of the analysed decalogues did not mention the consequences of
   disinformation, neither in the short nor in the long term. A 20\%
   explains the economic or political benefit that could be obtained from
   the dissemination of a deception and 15\% explains the possible damage
   to health or reputation. Only a 5\% mention the polarisation of public
   opinion. The secondary effects of fake news that institutional
   advertising exposed were: the damage to the digital identity,
   discrimination against individuals, the advantage of unethical
   businesses, the reduction in media confidence, the decrease in critical
   thinking, and the undermining of the confidence of institutions that do
   not even appear in the decalogues. Secondly, we appreciated a
   restriction of the campaigns to the child and adolescent public, as well
   as to adults in the role of parents. Dissemination is also a pending
   task for the institutions, since none of the initiatives were successful
   and went viral on Twitter, even less so in the case of the campaigns
   that we consider more complete in their approach. The conclusions of
   this work invite to revisit the institutional communication and
   advertising as tools for media and digital literacy through coordination
   with the media, journalists, educators, politicians and experts in the
   field. Order PCM / 1030/2020, of October 30, which publishes the
   procedure for action against disinformation opens a new path to study
   information disorders in Spain. From this point, the objective should be
   to analyse it from a structural prism which empowers citizens, not to
   assign them total responsibility for how they receive information.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study is to carry out a comparative analysis around the

   The study focuses mainly on four countries: Germany, France, Spain and
   the United Kingdom. The work aims to distinguish between legislative
   measures, digital literacy, reports, working groups, etc. as well as
   between internal and external measures. It means, those aimed at
   monitoring the propaganda and interference activities of third countries
   in the electoral processes.
   In any of these scenarios, digital legislation presents challenges that
   are repeated: a legislative model not adapted to digital changes,
   interests of traditional actors who don't want to lose their market
   shares and power and the unawareness of a new phenomena that quickly has
   been installed in our daily life.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigates how successful Russian Internet Research Agency
   (IRA) Twitter accounts constructed the followings that were central to
   their disinformation campaigns around the 2016 U.S. presidential
   election. Treating an account's social media following as both an ego
   network and an audience critical for information diffusion and influence
   accrual, we situate IRA Twitter accounts' accumulation of followers in
   the ideologically polarized, attention driven, and asymmetric political
   communication system. Results show that partisan enclaves on Twitter
   contributed to IRA accounts' followings through retweeting; and that
   mainstream and hyperpartisan media assisted conservative IRA accounts'
   following gain by embedding their tweets in news. These results
   illustrate how network dynamics within social media and news media
   amplification beyond it together boosted social media followings. Our
   results also highlight the dynamics fanning the flames of
   disinformation: partisan polarization, media fragmentation and
   asymmetry, and an attention economy optimized for engagement rather than
   accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{Considerable interest has recently emerged among communication scholars
   around what has been called the `information disorder', that is, a
   constellation of media genres that includes disinformation,
   misinformation, fake news, propaganda and hyperpartisan news. The rise
   in this type of information pollution is related to a crisis of public
   communication where the public sphere in many countries has become
   divided and challenged by social and political tensions. On the other
   hand, the digital space emerges as a socio-technological environment
   configured around platforms that condition emotional expression through
   their affordances, favoring the appearance of affective publics. Taking
   the above into account, this paper offers a conceptual framework for
   understanding the role played by emotions in our present `information
   disorder' and the societal risks that arise from it. It examines how
   fake news strategically relies on emotionally provocative content to
   induce outrage and other strong feelings among users, which are then
   viralized on platforms. The paper concludes by presenting some lines of
   action for minimizing those risks from the point of view of media
   literacy.}},

Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{101}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Fake news has now grown into a big problem for societies and also a
   major challenge for people fighting disinformation. This phenomenon
   plagues democratic elections, reputations of individual persons or
   organizations, and has negatively impacted citizens, (e.g., during the
   COVID-19 pandemic in the US or Brazil). Hence, developing effective
   tools to fight this phenomenon by employing advanced Machine Learning
   (ML) methods poses a significant challenge. The following paper displays
   the present body of knowledge on the application of such intelligent
   tools in the fight against disinformation. It starts by showing the
   historical perspective and the current role of fake news in the
   information war. Proposed solutions based solely on the work of experts
   are analysed and the most important directions of the application of
   intelligent systems in the detection of misinformation sources are
   pointed out. Additionally, the paper presents some useful resources
   (mainly datasets useful when assessing ML solutions for fake news
   detection) and provides a short overview of the most important R\&D
   projects related to this subject. The main purpose of this work is to
   analyse the current state of knowledge in detecting fake news; on the
   one hand to show possible solutions, and on the other hand to identify
   the main challenges and methodological gaps to motivate future research.

   media landscape, journalists find themselves in the spotlight as the
   media are frequently accused of spreading falsehoods. Drawing from data
   gathered through 16 semistructured in-depth interviews with Filipino
   journalists, the findings first of all indicate that the disseminator
   and watchdog roles are perceived as more important and that journalists
   see themselves as truth crusaders and advocates of societal reform.
   Second, journalists identify barriers on different levels of influence
   that impede the performance of these intended roles. Finally,
   journalists see the rise of mis- and disinformation as both a challenge
   and opportunity for journalism to improve as a practice and institution.
   These findings can be extrapolated to theoretical and practical

Abstract = {{Propaganda embraces psychological action and in some cases psychological
   warfare. Psychological action is where the propagandist attempts to
   change opinions using only psychological means where the individual or
   organization doubts the validity of their belief system and actions.
   Psychological warfare is the psychological action when it is applied to
   an adversary. Propaganda plays on personal complexes, drives,
   motivations, passions, and prejudices. The U.S. Senate Select Committee
   on Intelligence identified examples of this type of propaganda and
   manipulation with the Russian Federation conducting influence operations
   (IO) worldwide with the manipulation of social media, Democratic
   National Committee (DNC) decisions, election polls, and even TV station
   broadcasts. Offensively, these examples of soft cyber power directly
   support the Military Deception (MILDEC) used to deliberately mislead the

Title = {{Disinformation and Responsibility in Young People in Spain during the

Journal = {{PUBLICATIONS}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{This paper analyzes the main variables that determine the relationship
   between disinformation and youth responsibility during the latest stage
   of the COVID-19 pandemic in Spain (from April to June 2021). Are young
   people keeping well informed during the COVID-19 pandemic in Spain? Are
   the youth behaving responsibly? This document presents several results
   regarding these questions. In our introduction, we establish a
   theoretical framework for the following concepts: disinformation,
   responsibility, credibility, and youth responsibility variables. Our
   primary interest is in communication factors. The applied methods are a
   reference review of the national and international literature
   surrounding this subject and qualitative opinion research conducted
   through discussion groups with young university students from private
   and public communication schools in Madrid. A recent study, held in June
   2021, provides valuable material for this paper. The main results and
   findings are as follows: not being satisfied with the information
   received about COVID-19; knowledge about the most credible news sources;
   the connection between information and responsibility; and the solutions
   that are claimed to more responsible in this context by various youth
   participants. In conclusion, this paper confirms the first hypothesis of
   considering disinformation as a variable that causes a lack of personal
   responsibility among youths in complying with public health
   expectations. Regarding the second hypothesis, we verify that young
   people consider communication one of the main solutions for being more
   responsible. In other words, when presented with more information about
   COVID-19 they feel more aware of the disease.}},

   prominent challenge for all the democratic states. In Slovakia, this
   problem entered public discourse around 2014, however mostly as a result
   of activities of media and civil society. The Slovak Information
   Service, an intelligence agency responsible the protection from both
   internal and external threats, reacted to this thread relatively late
   according to its published annual reports. The threat of disinformation
   was first formulated in the annual report for the year 2016, however
   only briefly. It was described more specifically in the report for year
   2018, which also identified Russia as its perpetrator. This article
   discusses the construction of the threat of disinformation by means of
   political discourse analysis.}},

Title = {{Constructing Discourses on (Un)truthfulness: Attributions of Reality,
   Misinformation, and Disinformation by Politicians in a Comparative
   Social Media Setting}},
Journal = {{COMMUNICATION RESEARCH}},
Abstract = {{In the setting of increasingly more fragmented digital communication
   settings, the accuracy and honesty of (political) information has become
   subject of fierce debates and partisan attacks. Hence, the challenge of
   mis- and disinformation not only pertains to the truthfulness of
   information itself, but also to the discursive construction of
   supporting information as truthful and dissonant information as untrue
   or deliberately false. This paper inductively analyzes discourses of
   (un)truthfulness (Study 1, N = 1,777) and uses an Automated Content
   Analysis (Study 2, N = 56,666) to assess how reality, mis-, and
   disinformation are constructed by politicians in Austria, Germany, and
   the Netherlands. The findings point to an affinity between populism and
   disinformation: Right-wing populist politicians take issue ownership in
   discrediting established knowledge and attempt to create momentum for
   alternative realities that resonate with populist worldviews. Such
   discourses of (un)truthfulness may have an important impact on defining
   reality for voters.}},

Title = {{Correlations between the concepts of disinformation and Fogg's Behavior
   Model}},
Journal = {{TRANSINFORMACAO}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{32}},
Abstract = {{As connectivity and interactions on the Internet and social media grew
   easier, it made it possible for any individual to create and disseminate
   information or news as desired, which resulted in the growth of
   disinformation, leading to questions of how human beings can be
   manipulated by false information. The main objective of this research is
   to correlate the concepts of false news and misinformation with Fogg's
   Behavior Model. By considering the correlation between the definitions
   and concepts applied by the selected bodies and institutions and the
   factors of Fogg's Behavior Model, we conclude that all the definitions
   have aspects correlated with the factors raised by Fogg for the
   persuasion toward a desired behavior, thus showing how false information
   can be used to manipulate individuals who are likely to believe in a
   certain topic, those who do not have knowledge of voiliability
   procedures for misinformation or those who have already been affected by
   informational fatigue.}},

Abstract = {{The rise of digital platforms has provided an opportunity for an
   unprecedented expansion of the public sphere; however, the recent
   proliferation of online disinformation, automated propaganda as well as
   hate speech has substantially hampered their potential to become an
   instrument for more egalitarian and participatory communication in a
   democratic society. In many countries, the ascent of right-wing populism
   in recent years has been associated with the establishing of an
   alternative information environment that includes a variety of fringe
   news websites that frequently engage in spreading rumours, hoaxes and
   conspiracy theories. Attempting to fill the gap in the scholarship that
   predominantly tends to focus on the US and Western European political
   and media context, this article aims to map the disinformation ecosystem
   and its audiences in the Czech Republic, a country where the online
   disinformation scene has been particularly active in recent years.
   Following an outline of the evolution of the Czech media system over the
   course of the last three decades, this study utilises data from the
   2018-2020 Digital News Report surveys to provide empirical insights into
   the characteristics of the consumers of the most prominent
   disinformation news websites in the Czech Republic. In conclusions, the
   paper evaluates the challenges these new patterns of (dis)information
   consumption pose for the post-transition public sphere in the Czech
   Republic, especially in context of the processes of democratic
   deconsolidation and the rise of illiberalism.}},

Abstract = {{Disinformation is one of the great challenges that communication
   research has addressed in the last five years. It is therefore necessary

   general cartography of these topics. A systematic literature review was
   conducted through a Mixed Method Research Design integrating qualitative
   analysis and descriptive and inferential statistics. Although a
   significant thematic dispersion is observed, there is a tendency towards
   the study of the solutions to address this problem, especially from the
   journalistic field, taking fact-checking as a relevant actor. Likewise,
   this study detects a high interest in the discursive dimension of the
   phenomenon and the analysis of its possible causes; as opposed to other
   fundamental topics to understand the problem, such as the spread of
   false content online and the biases operating in its reception.}},

Abstract = {{In today's high-information and high-communication society, university
   students are increasingly involved in autonomous and collaborative
   learning processes, which require active methodologies to facilitate the
   integration of social competencies. The objective of this study was to
   raise awareness of the risks of disinformation and infodemics and to
   identify the main social competencies and skills related to
   fact-checking that students should acquire. Based on
   thematicexperiential classes and through the project-based learning
   methodology, this teaching experience consisted of lecturing a fake
   class in the communication degree programme, in which the professor gave
   a speech to 150 students about coronavirus that contained both hoaxes
   and true information, thus challenging students to identify false
   information. The results obtained in this qualitative study are divided
   into three parts to answer each research question. The first part is
   focused on identifying the most influential hoaxes about the coronavirus
   that young people have embraced as reliable information during the 2020
   pandemic (RQ1). The second part is dedicated to explaining students'
   reactions when they are involved in infodemic contexts. We also point
   out the main challenge that arose in a period of infodemics (RQ2). In
   the third part, we propose the main fact-checking skills that students
   should acquire to tackle disinformation in a period of infodemics (RQ3).
   Training in these skills appeared to improve job performance and
   undoubtedly contributed to the personal development of our future
   graduates.}},

Abstract = {{The recent spread of online disinformation has been profound and has
   played a central role in the growth of populist sentiments around the
   world. Facilitating its progression has been politically and
   economically motivated culprits who have ostensibly taken advantage of
   the digital freedoms available to them. At the heart of these freedoms
   lie social media organisations that only a few years earlier
   techno-optimists were identifying as catalysts of an enhanced digital
   democracy. In order to curtail the erosion of information, policy reform
   will no doubt be essential. The UK's Department of Digital, Culture,
   Media and Sport Disinformation and `fake news' Report and Cairncross
   Review, and the European Commission's Report on Disinformation are three
   recent examples seeking to investigate how precisely such reform policy
   might be implemented. Just as important is how social media
   organisations take on more responsibility and apply self-regulating
   mechanisms that stifle disinformation across their platforms (something
   the aforementioned reports identify). Doing so will go a long way in
   restoring legitimacy in these significant institutions. Facebook (which
   includes Instagram and Whatsapp), is the largest social media
   organisation in the world and must primarily bear the burden of this
   responsibility. The purpose of this article is to offer a descriptive
   account of Facebook's public announcements regarding how it tackles
   disinformation and fake news. Based on a qualitative content analysis
   covering the period November 16th 2016-March 4th 2019, this article will
   set out some groundwork on how to hold social media platforms more
   accountable for how they handle disinformation.}},

Abstract = {{Disinformation has been one of the most analyzed issues in recent years
   in media studies. However, there is still a lack of research on young
   media professionals ` perceptions about this problem. They are
   considered to be essential in the adoption of future strategies to
   tackle fake news. This research intends to discover the hegemonic ideas
   of new journalists on this problem and how they perceive its possible
   solutions. A total of 45 in-depth interviews with Generation Z
   journalists (mean age: 24.14 years) were carried out, complemented with
   two focus groups and the application of a semantic differential scale,
   whose results were analyzed using both descriptive and inferential
   statistics. New journalists affirm the solution to the problem should be
   approached from a convergent technocentrism that combines technological
   determinism with a traditionalist perspective that resorts to the old
   values of journalism to combat the information disorders that
   proliferate today. Data journalism, which merges traditional
   journalistic practices with new technological tools, is perceived as a
   more effective solution than fact- checking and artificial intelligence,
   even though the latter two practices are considered as faster strategies
   to tackle disinformation. Likewise, new journalists highlight the need
   to develop digital, critical, and media literacy for citizens.}},

Abstract = {{This paper focuses on the spread of disinformation on novel coronavirus
   (COVID-19) and creating the larger phenomena of information disorder. It
   analyses an array of definitional meaning and disinformation on
   COVID-19, which has been identified and grounded with valid information
   by the fact-checkers. The study's aim is to explore and analyse the
   intents behind the circulation of misleading information (intended and
   unintended) on COVID-19. For the study, quantitative content analysis
   and qualitative discourse analysis methods were utilised to explore the
   extent of the misleading information on COVID-19. Further, in-depth
   interviews were conducted with factcheckers, media professionals,
   academicians, and a psychologist to understand the purpose of
   disinformation and its impact on society at large. The study's findings
   propose that fact-checking is a crucial method to identify
   fake/misleading information, which can be counter acted by accurate and
   verified information. This paper argues that holding journalists,
   fact-checkers, the Government, and the citizens' accountable, is
   necessary to counter the threat of disinformation about the pandemic.}},

Abstract = {{There is considerable concern about the propagation of disinformation
   through social media, particularly for political purposes. ``Organic
   reach{''} has been found to be important in the propagation of
   disinformation on social networks. This is the phenomenon whereby social
   media users extend the audience for a piece of information: interacting
   with it, or sharing it with their wider networks, greatly increases the
   number of people the information reaches. This project evaluated the
   extent to which characteristics of the message source (how trustworthy
   they were) and the recipient (risk propensity and personality)
   influenced the organic reach of a potentially false message. In an
   online study, 357 Facebook users completed personality and risk
   propensity scales and rated their likelihood of interacting in various
   ways with a message posted by either a trustworthy or untrustworthy
   source. Message source impacted on overall organic reach, with messages
   from trusted sources being more likely to be propagated. Risk propensity
   did not influence reach. However, low scores on trait agreeableness
   predicted greater likelihood of interacting with a message. The findings
   provide preliminary evidence that both message source and recipient
   characteristics can potentially influence the spread of disinformation.}},

Abstract = {{Since its political independence in 1960, Nigeria has been a partially
   united country. Nigerians have always regarded themselves as `us' versus
   `them.' This creates a fertile ground for the propagation of hate speech
   and disinformation. The Fourth Republic in Nigerian democracy, which
   triumphantly began in 1999, after 16 years of military rule is now in
   its 21st year. However, since the emergence of the Trumpian fake news
   era in 2016, the Nigerian democratic atmosphere has been polluted with
   more devastating hate messages and disinformation which, aided by the
   `supersonic' social media, threaten the nations hard-earned democracy.
   As the constitutional watchdogs of the society, journalists are tasked
   to cleanse the democratic atmosphere of the filths of disinformation and
   hostility. To help the journalists achieve this goal, this article
   proposes the Journalism Model of Disinformation and Hate Speech

Abstract = {{The spread of disinformation during the Covid-19 pandemic is largely
   associated with social media and online messengers. Viral disinformation
   disseminated in 2020-2021 was related to a wide range of topics that
   caused panic among people. Many false narratives emerged and attracted
   public interest over time, which mainly reflected the general public's
   utmost belief in these topics. Text mining can be used to analyze the
   frequencies of keywords and topic-related vocabulary in order to track
   the changing focus of the public concerning online disinformation. In
   this paper, we present the results of a corpus-based study of Russian
   viral fake stories circulating during the first year of the Covid-19
   pandemic. We propose a method for analyzing the central topics and
   dynamics of topical change in the context of the Russian Covid-19-fake
   story. In order to accomplish this objective, we make use of a set of
   tools to extract keywords, count their frequencies and analyze
   corresponding contexts. We apply these tools to the compiled specialized
   diachronic corpus of Russian viral false Covid-19-related stories. The
   obtained data is evaluated to determine the dynamic of topical shifts by
   tracking the changes in keyword frequencies as well as the use of other
   high-frequency corpus words. The findings of the work concerning topical
   fluctuations in the Russian viral Covid-19 disinformation agenda as well
   as given explanations for the identified drifts in public interest in
   the topics during the first year of the pandemic can contribute to
   developing effective strategies for combating the spread of fakes in the
   future.}},

   interconnected network of institutions, processes, and actors, all of
   which must coordinate together to ensure electoral effectiveness and
   legitimacy. An electoral ecosystem is comprised of multiple institutions
   and actors, including governments, political parties, voters, third
   parties, online platforms, and electoral management bodies. Given the
   interdependence and interconnected nature of an electoral system, there
   are multiple points of vulnerability that must be defended. An electoral
   ecosystem approach does not depend on any one single line of defense but
   instead relies on a multiplicity of strategies that protect the
   institutions and individuals that comprise the ecosystem. To further
   explore the electoral ecosystem approach, this article focuses on
   Canada's response to foreign interference in elections. The ecosystem
   approach consists of three principal strategies. The first strategy
   involves a set of new campaign finance regulations which directly
   prevents the influence of foreign individuals and groups on the
   election. The second strategy consists of new measures to reduce
   disinformation and to lessen its distorting impact on democratic
   discourse. To the extent that foreign election interference takes place
   through social media, efforts to reduce disinformation will also reduce
   the impact of foreign interference. The third strategy involves
   strengthening Canadian cybersecurity. A number of steps have been taken
   recently, including the coordination of Canada's security agencies and
   the adoption of new measures to prevent computer hacking and privacy
   intrusions. These three strategies, and the multiple measures within
   each, provide protection across the electoral ecosystem.}},

Abstract = {{Disinformation is a reality that affects society in general and
   journalism and the media in particular. The role of professionals in
   this field is generally recognized. To get to know it better, this
   article looks at the perception that a sample of journalists has about
   the phenomenon and about professional routines in the digital age.
   Twelve structured interviews were conducted. Of these, ten to general
   journalists from public and private news, press, radio and television
   companies; and two to specialists in digital verification of the two
   main platforms in Spain, which are also the pioneers, due to their
   foundation in 2018: Maldita.es and Newtral. The results show unanimity
   among journalists on the magnitude of the phenomenon, as well as a
   predominance of classic techniques to contrast information and check
   sources. It is worth mentioning the new phenomenon of the communities of
   followers with which journalists from the verification platforms have,
   which have involved audiences, so that these communities not only alert
   about unfounded rumors that arise on social networks or WhatsApp, but
   also they participate as specialized sources in certain areas of
   knowledge.}},

Abstract = {{Despite a fast-growing body of literature on fake news and
   mis-/disinformation, there remains surprisingly little empirical work on
   the social/political consequences of exposure to false information.
   Addressing this issue, this study provides initial evidence that
   perceptions of false information exposure catalyze political cynicism.
   The findings from a two-wave panel survey during the 2018 US midterm
   elections reveal that perceptions of false information exposure 2 weeks
   before the election significantly predict the changes in political
   cynicism immediately after the election day. We also find that social
   media news use in Wave 1 significantly relates to political cynicism in
   Wave 2 indirectly through perceptions of mis-/disinformation exposure.
   The autoregressive regression model indicates that our findings are
   robust after controlling for prior levels of cynicism.}},

Journal = {{POLITICAL COMMUNICATION}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{37}},
Number = {{2, SI}},

Month = {{MAR 3}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we address the question of whether disinforming news
   spread online possesses the power to change the prevailing political
   circumstances during an election campaign. We highlight factors for
   believing disinformation that until now have received little attention,
   namely trust in news media and trust in politics. A panel survey in the
   context of the 2017 German parliamentary election (N = 989) shows that
   believing disinforming news had a specific impact on vote choice by
   alienating voters from the main governing party (i.e., the CDU/CSU), and
   driving them into the arms of right-wing populists (i.e., the AfD).
   Furthermore, we demonstrate that the less one trusts in news media and
   politics, the more one believes in online disinformation. Hence, we
   provide empirical evidence for Bennett and Livingston's notion of a
   disinformation order, which forms in opposition to the established
   information system to disrupt democracy.}},

Journal = {{COMPUTERS \& SECURITY}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{86}},
Pages = {{402-418}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Advanced persistent threat (APT) is widely acknowledged to be the most
   sophisticated and potent class of security threat. APT refers to
   knowledgeable human attackers that are organized, highly sophisticated
   and motivated to achieve their objectives against a targeted
   organization(s) over a prolonged period. Strategically-motivated APTs or
   S-APTs are distinct in that they draw their objectives from the broader
   strategic agenda of third parties such as criminal syndicates,
   nation-states, and rival corporations. In this paper we review the use
   of the term ``advanced persistent threat,{''} and present a formal
   definition. We then draw on military science, the science of organized
   conflict, for a theoretical basis to develop a rigorous and holistic
   model of the stages of an APT operation which we subsequently use to
   explain how S-APTs execute their strategically motivated operations
   using tactics, techniques and procedures. Finally, we present a general
   disinformation model, derived from situation awareness theory, and
   explain how disinformation can be used to attack the situation awareness
   and decision making of not only S-APT operators, but also the entities
   that back them. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   semiotic-cognitive perspective}},
Journal = {{EDUCATION FOR INFORMATION}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{34}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{185-197}},
Abstract = {{Based on recent political happenings, such as Brexit (UK) and the
   election of Donald Trump (USA), it has become clear that political
   marketing has been using `Big Data' intensively. Information gathered
   from social media networks is organized into digital environments and
   has the power to determine the outcome of elections, plebiscites and
   popular consultations. New advertising and persuasion mechanisms have
   been created to undermine the reliability of traditional mass media
   communication that are familiar to the general audience. Consequently,
   `fake news' and `alternative facts' have emerged along with the notion
   of `post-truth', which defines the state of affairs represented in
   public opinion that has been contaminated by these strategies. Based on
   the pragmatic-semiotic concepts developed by Peirce, such as belief,
   mental habits, controlled action, final opinion, truth, and reality, we
   argue that the `global village', (McLuhan, 2008) may be at a dangerous
   fork in the road. This author's `scientific method' was elaborated based
   on (1) the concatenation of hypotheses, (2) the deduction of its
   consequences, and (3) the design of experiences and aims to test our
   beliefs against our results which would be critically evaluated by
   communities of researchers. This fork in the road, which rapidly evolves
   as a dystopia built and reaffirmed by the spread of disinformation on
   social networks, points towards a `post-reality' that can represent an
   illusory and brief comfort zone for those who live in it but may also
   represent a tragedy with no turning back for our entire civilization.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we describe the concept and ongoing work of the project
   defalsif-AI, which addresses the protection of critical infrastructures
   against disinformation and fake news. Defalsif-AI deals particularly
   with the protection of the main democratic processes and the public
   trust in democracy and its institutions against engineered social media
   attacks, which, for example, attempt to manipulate the electoral
   process. Federal ministries and media institutions require new methods
   and tools to evaluate the ever increasing amount of digital media in
   terms of identification, verification, and correction of sources. Based
   on these requirements, the project focuses on research on audio-visual
   media forensics, text analysis, and multimodal fusion with the support
   of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning methods. One main
   focus of this research is to make the results more comprehensible and
   interpretable for non-experts in the forensic/technical field. The
   primary project outcome is a proof of concept of a multimodal detection
   platform, which can operate with a variety of sources, including the
   surface web and social media. Additional research carried out within the
   project focuses on providing and generating multimodal data necessary to
   train and test machine learning models. Finally, an analysis and
   assessment concerning the law and social science are carried out as
   well.}},

   Factitious (Augame Studio, 2017-20). To this end, a qualitative analysis
   methodology is used to explain its narrative structure, informative
   purpose and playful-interactive proposal. The results reflect a primary
   discursive strategy oriented to the roleplaying of the players as
   creators, verifiers or disseminators of false news that responds to a
   wide range of topics (from political issues to those related to
   COVID-19). In this way, these games teach the dissemination strategies
   of this type of hoaxes and identify the motivation for their production.}},

Title = {{Forged Examples as Disinformation: The Biasing Effects of Political
   Astroturfing Comments on Public Opinion Perceptions and How to Prevent
   Them}},
Journal = {{POLITICAL PSYCHOLOGY}},
Abstract = {{Online astroturfing is a novel form of disinformation that relies on the
   imitation of citizen voices to create the false impression that a
   particular view or idea has widespread support in society. In this
   study, we test if political online astroturfing messages (i.e., forged
   user comments beneath digital news items) can influence perceptions of
   public opinion on three issues: the poisoning of the former Russian
   intelligence officer Sergei Skripal, the use of toxic gas by Russia's
   close ally Syria, and the manipulation of the 2016 U.S. presidential
   election. We further examine the immunizing effects of three inoculation
   strategies to prevent the distorting effects of online astroturfing
   comments. Our results indicate that only a few astroturfing comments can
   bias readers' perceptions of public opinion in the intended direction.
   Moreover, prior inoculation only provides limited protection against
   this effect. Only one inoculation strategy (refutational-same) proved to
   be effective, but even this effect is only short-term. Our findings
   indicate that recent fears about the potentially negative effects of
   this novel form of disinformation on political discourse are justified
   and underscore the difficulties of responding to this challenge.}},

Abstract = {{The explosion of disinformation accompanying the COVID-19 pandemic has
   overloaded fact-checkers and media worldwide, and brought a new major
   challenge to government responses worldwide. Not only is disinformation
   creating confusion about medical science amongst citizens, but it is
   also amplifying distrust in policy makers and governments. To help
   tackle this, we developed computational methods to categorise COVID-19
   disinformation. The COVID-19 disinformation categories could be used for
   a) focusing fact-checking efforts on the most damaging kinds of COVID-19
   disinformation; b) guiding policy makers who are trying to deliver
   effective public health messages and counter effectively COVID-19
   disinformation. This paper presents: 1) a corpus containing what is
   currently the largest available set of manually annotated COVID-19
   disinformation categories; 2) a classification-aware neural topic model
   (CANTM) designed for COVID-19 disinformation category classification and

Title = {{``Who is gullible to political disinformation?{''} : predicting
   susceptibility of university students to fake news}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY \& POLITICS}},
Abstract = {{This study determined the items that could predict university students'
   susceptibility to disinformation (e.g., fake news). Toward this goal,
   randomly-selected students from the four private universities in Manila
   answered a content-validated and pilot-tested survey form. Through
   binary logistic regression analysis, it was found that frequent visits
   to Instagram, sharing a political post of a friend, and liking a post of
   a political party could increase the susceptibility of students to fake
   news. On the other hand, sharing the post of a political party, and
   seeking the opinion of experts could decrease the susceptibility of
   students to fake news. Of these items, liking a post with a similar
   opinion of a political party - a confirmation bias - had the highest
   contribution to fake news susceptibility of students. It is worth noting
   that the most reliable source of information, i.e. the library, is the
   least utilized fact-checking resource. It can be concluded that
   technological, internal, and external factors contribute either
   positively or negatively to the susceptibility of students to fake news.
   Implications to combat fake news are offered.}},

Journal = {{RELIABILITY ENGINEERING \& SYSTEM SAFETY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{193}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Motivated by the defense of a power grid control center against
   cyber-attacks, this research considers the optimal allocation of defense
   resources for defending a parallel system consisting of identical
   elements. To enhance the system survivability, the defender distributes
   its limited resources to provide redundancy, disinform the attacker, and
   protect system elements. Correspondingly, the attacker allocates its
   limited resources to intelligence actions and impact contests. The
   defender determines the optimal number of genuine elements and false
   elements to deploy and the optimal amount of resources used for
   disinformation actions. The attacker seeks to maximize the system damage
   by taking the defender's strategy as given and allocating its resources
   optimally into intelligence actions and impact contests. Two types of
   parallel systems are considered: (1) where the system damage is defined
   as the probability of system failure, and (2) where the system damage is
   defined as the unsupplied demand of the system. Due to the complexity of
   the optimization model, we analyze the optimal defense strategy under
   various parameter settings via numerical methods. The results provide
   useful insights on how to defend such a system under different
   situations.}},

Abstract = {{The problem of ``fake news{''} has received considerable attention both
   in public discourse and in scholarship. However, many have argued that
   the term should be avoided for ideological reasons or because it lacks

   ``fake news{''} empirically. We complement this discussion by reflecting
   on epistemological and methodological problems with the term ``fake
   news{''} and the implications for possible solutions to the problem of
   disinformation such as automatic detection and increased media literacy.
   Based on the principle of symmetry established in the sociology of
   scientific knowledge, we show that a classification of messages
   according to the researcher's assessment of their truthfulness can lead
   to biased or tautological explanations. We argue that many researchers
   commit themselves to the truth or falsehood of messages in cases where
   they should not and avoid such a commitment when it is necessary.}},

Abstract = {{Disinformation constitutes a serious threat to the democratic exercise
   of journalism and to societies in general. While the press adheres to
   the recommendations and ethical codes of different organizations to
   protect citizens' rights to receive truthful information, digital media
   offer more and more possibilities for audience participation. Pertaining
   to this dual reality, this research deals with the user-generated
   contents verification systems of the most important digital native
   newspapers in Spain and Portugal. For this job, those responsible for
   the systems within each newspaper were interviewed. The conclusions
   indicate that newspapers attach great importance to the involvement of
   audiences in news production, though they also expose the lack of
   verification systems for the information provided by the public. This
   work provides the analysis of specific cases and the perspective of
   professionals in the fight against disinformation. It is argued here
   that it is not enough for the media to adhere to external deontological
   guidelines, but rather that they should develop internal news
   verification systems to regain their credibility, as was the case, for
   example, during the Coronavirus pandemic (ComScore, 2020).}},

Abstract = {{Over the past couple of years, anecdotal evidence has emerged linking
   coordinated campaigns by state-sponsored actors with efforts to
   manipulate public opinion on the Web, often around major political
   events, through dedicated accounts, or ``trolls.{''} Although they are
   often involved in spreading disinformation on social media, there is
   little understanding of how these trolls operate, what type of content
   they disseminate, and most importantly their influence on the
   information ecosystem.
   In this paper, we shed light on these questions by analyzing 27K tweets
   posted by 1K Twitter users identified as having ties with Russia's
   Internet Research Agency and thus likely state-sponsored trolls. We
   compare their behavior to a random set of Twitter users, finding
   interesting differences in terms of the content they disseminate, the
   evolution of their account, as well as their general behavior and use of
   Twitter. Then, using Hawkes Processes, we quantify the influence that
   trolls had on the dissemination of news on social platforms like
   Twitter, Reddit, and 4chan. Overall, our findings indicate that Russian
   trolls managed to stay active for long periods of time and to reach a
   substantial number of Twitter users with their tweets. When looking at
   their ability of spreading news content and making it viral, however, we
   find that their effect on social platforms was minor, with the
   significant exception of news published by the Russian state-sponsored
   news outlet RT (Russia Today).}},

   understanding complex mis- and dis-information phenomena. One purpose is
   to offer readers an understanding of the mis- and disinformation studies
   landscape, and advocate for the merit of taking the given approach the
   authors outline.
   Design/methodology/approach - The paper builds upon design-based
   research (DBR) methods. In this paper, the authors present the actual
   curriculum that will be empirically researched in 2022 and beyond in a
   program of iterative DBR.
   Findings - Findings of this conceptual paper comprise a fully
   articulated undergraduate syllabus for a course the authors entitled,
   ``Disinformation Detox.{''} The authors will iterate upon this
   curriculum development in ongoing situated studies conducted in
   undergraduate classrooms.
   Originality/value - The value and originality of this article is in its
   contribution of the ontological ``innovation{''} of a way of framing the
   mis- and dis-information knowledge domain in terms of social shaping and
   critical informatics theories. The authors argue that the proposed
   approach offers students the opportunity to cultivate a complex form of
   what Milner and Phillips describe as ``ecological literacy{''} that is
   in keeping with the mis- and dis-information problem domain.}},

Abstract = {{The intentional spread of disinformation is not a new challenge for the
   scientific world. We have seen it perpetuate the idea of a flat earth,
   convince communities that vaccines are more dangerous than helpful, and
   even suggest a connection between the ``5G{''} communication
   infrastructure and COVID-19. Nor is disinformation a new phenomenon in
   the weapons inspection arena. Weapons inspectors themselves are often
   forced to sift through alternative narratives of events and inconsistent
   reporting, and they regularly see their credibility and conclusions
   questioned in the face of government politics or public biases. But
   certain recent disinformation campaigns have become so overwhelmingly
   comprehensive and effective that they constitute a new kind of threat.
   By preventing accountability for clear violations of international law,
   these campaigns have created a challenge to the survival of arms control
   treaties themselves. If weapons inspectors cannot regain the trust of
   the international community in the face of this challenge, it will be
   increasingly difficult to ensure compliance with arms control and
   disarmament treaties going forward. In this essay, I will briefly
   discuss one of the most comprehensive disinformation efforts of the past
   decade: the disinformation campaign used to prevent accountability for
   Syria's repeated use of chemical weapons. After this discussion, I will
   propose one possible approach to help protect the credibility of
   disarmament experts and weapons inspectors in the face of pervasive
   disinformation. This approach will require a concerted effort to connect
   and support compliance experts and to understand and explain their
   expertise across cultural, political, national, economic, and religious
   divides.}},

Title = {{Visual Mis/disinformation in Journalism and Public Communications:
   Current Verification Practices, Challenges, and Future Opportunities}},
Journal = {{JOURNALISM PRACTICE}},
Abstract = {{Social media platforms and news organisations alike are struggling with
   identifying and combating visual mis/disinformation presented to their
   audiences. Such processes are complicated due to the enormous number of
   media items being produced, how quickly media items spread, and the
   often-subtle or sometimes invisible-to-the-naked-eye nature of deceptive
   edits. Despite knowing little about the provenance and veracity of the
   visual content they encounter, journalists have to quickly determine
   whether to re-publish or amplify this content, with few tools and little
   time available to assist them in such an evaluation. With the goal of
   equipping journalists with the mechanisms, skills, and knowledge to be
   effective gatekeepers and stewards of the public trust, this study
   reviews current journalistic image verification practices, examines a
   number of existing and emerging image verification technologies that
   could be deployed or adapted to aid in this endeavour, and identifies
   the strengths and limitations of the most promising extant technical
   approaches. While oriented towards practical and achievable steps in
   combating visual mis/disinformation, the study also contributes to
   discussions on fact-checking, source-checking, verification, debunking
   and journalism training and education.}},

Pages = {{111-129}},
Abstract = {{This research aims to determine the need for a crisis management model
   on reputational risks related to media misinformation. Companies
   recognize that they are facing a new corporate risk and the professional
   communication sector recognizes the urgency of having measures in the
   face of a hoax event. For this, the research carried out on Spanish
   companies on their perception of risk is taken as a starting point,
   where it was determined that for the professional the risks derived from
   misinformation are highly dangerous and the gap between the professional
   perception and the priorities of the organization. This qualitative
   report, with focus groups on a qualified sample of those responsible for
   the reputation and corporate communication of Spanish companies, reviews
   the trend of these crises and the system used in crisis management. The
   results corroborate the need to create a base methodology that collects
   the foundations on which disinformation acts. This fact is giving rise
   to new work dynamics and provides knowledge in the creation of efficient
   dynamics for the fight against misinformation. The conclusions propose a
   methodological scheme that can improve the work of communication

   assess the patient-centered care in medical disinformation era among
   patients attending tertiary care teaching hospital, Rishikesh. Materials
   and Methods: A descriptive cross-sectional study was planned by
   enrolling 240 patients attending tertiary care teaching hospital. Total
   consecutive sampling technique was chosen to recruit the patients for
   the study. Tools: Tools used were case reporting form and components of
   primary care index (CPCI). Results: The results show statistically
   significant association between chronic history of illness of patient (P
   = 0.02), education of patient (P = 0.008), and habitat of patient (P =
   0.05) with interpersonal communication between patient and physician,
   and the results also show statistically significant association between
   accumulated knowledge (P = 0.000), coordination of care (P = 0.001),
   continuity belief (P = 0.000), comprehensiveness of care (P = 0.001),
   and first contact (P = 0.001) with interpersonal communication between
   patient and physician. The lowest mean percentage of patient-centered
   care score was observed for accumulated knowledge (65.70\%) and the
   highest mean percentage (85.15\%) score of patient-centered care was
   observed for interpersonal communication. Conclusions: This study
   concluded that patient-centered care improves interpersonal

Abstract = {{Artificial Intelligence (AI) now enables the mass creation of what have
   become known as ``deepfakes{''}: synthetic videos that closely resemble
   real videos. Integrating theories about the power of visual
   communication and the role played by uncertainty in undermining trust in
   public discourse, we explain the likely contribution of deepfakes to
   online disinformation. Administering novel experimental treatments to a
   large representative sample of the United Kingdom population allowed us
   to compare people's evaluations of deepfakes. We find that people are
   more likely to feel uncertain than to be misled by deepfakes, but this
   resulting uncertainty, in turn, reduces trust in news on social media.
   We conclude that deepfakes may contribute toward generalized
   indeterminacy and cynicism, further intensifying recent challenges to
   online civic culture in democratic societies.}},

   methodological proposal is based on an exploratory content analysis of
   the newsgames, to identify the mechanics, dynamics, and narrative

   of mechanics and dynamics allows complex arguments to be created in a
   way that is consistent with news standards. Thus, the intersection of

Abstract = {{Information warfare occupies an important place in cyber warfare and is
   aimed at influencing societies and states in 2 levels. This particularly
   true of Russian information warfare, which has 2 fundamental tasks, 1st,
   to accomplish political objectives without engaging in kinetic warfare,
   and 2nd, to influence, in a positive way, the international response to
   the deployment of Russian military and Russian allies. (Information
   Warfare: Russian Activities). At the individual level having accurate
   information is important because it is at the foundation of our decision
   making processes. When we are engaged in projects in the surrounding
   world, in order to accomplish our goals we need accurate information in
   order to determine the best ways to accomplish these goals. The same
   distinctions apply to nation states. They also need to use information
   in order to develop their policies and to achieve their political and
   geopolitical goals. Cyber warfare now includes information warfare where
   information is capable of being fabricated and also distorted, in order
   to disinform audiences, which has an impact upon individuals and nation
   states. At this point in time the advance of emerging technologies such
   as photo editing, Face Apps on smart phones, project voco, voice mimicry
   and voice imitating with emotion software, are technological
   developments that create the possibility for altering reports about what
   occurs in the world around us. Emerging technologies medicate between
   our experience and the objective world. What this means is that
   information about the surrounding world is capable of being
   significantly altered in a number of ways. This is due to how these
   emerging technologies can be employed to alter how and what information
   is presented to audiences. There are a number of ways in which
   technologies can alter and mediate between ourselves and the external
   world which in the process alters our experience of the surrounding
   world. This is already occurring in photo editing, Face Apps on smart
   phones, and will continue to occur as new technologies such as project
   voco, voice mimicry and voice imitating with emotion software
   developments, continue to evolve. This analysis is aimed at identifying
   and examining some of the technologies that can be employed to fabricate
   and distort information about what seems to be occurring in the external
   world. This fabrication and distortion has a potentially strong impact
   upon how audiences experience what has supposedly occurred in the world,
   which then serves to disinform these audiences. This creates further
   difficulties related to identifying facts about the world as well as
   influencing an audiences understanding of what amounts to information.
   This analysis explores how the use of these technologies will be
   conjoined to influence warfare to engage in information warfare in the
   future. An ethical analysis will show these technologies are misused now
   and how they will be misused now and into the future. Understanding how
   fabrication, distortion and disinformation are occurring will provide a
   foundation for developing policy about how to address disinformation
   warfare. It is important to attempt to identify if these technologies
   will lead to the fundamental nature of information warfare through the
   influence of ever more sophisticated influence operations.}},

Abstract = {{In the years 1945-52, that is, between Raoul Wallenberg's incarceration
   in the Lubianka prison in Moscow (6 February 1945) and the first Swedish
   demand for his return (11 February 1952), more than fifty people
   provided the Swedish Foreign Ministry with diffuse and often
   contradictory information about his whereabouts. This article argues
   that a number of these testimonies may have been part of a Soviet
   campaign of disinformation aimed at diverting the Swedes' attention away
   from Moscow and to have them believe that Wallenberg had died in
   Hungary. The appearance of messages to this effect by February-March
   1945 may indicate that the Soviets had already decided at this early
   point never to let Wallenberg return alive, or at least to construct an
   option that would allow for such a decision. In August 1947, after
   twenty-six Swedish diplomatic approaches on account of Wallenberg over
   the course of two and a half years, the Soviets handed over a note
   signed by Deputy Foreign Minister Andrei Vyshinskii that declared that
   Wallenberg had presumably died in Hungary. The note had the desired
   effect. No Swedish diplomatic approaches on Wallenberg were made for the
   next five years. This article argues that the Vyshinskii note was an
   extraordinary measure taken by the Soviets finally to get the message of
   Wallenberg's death in Hungary through to the Swedes. The Soviet
   disinformation regarding the 1940 Katyn massacre provides an interesting
   point of reference for understanding the way in which the Soviets tried
   to mislead Sweden over Wallenberg.}},

Journal = {{SOCIAL SCIENCE JOURNAL}},
Abstract = {{False political information spreads far and fast across social media,
   with negative consequences for society. Individual users play a key role
   in sharing such material, extending its range through the phenomenon of
   organic reach. An online experiment tested the hypotheses that higher
   trust in the source of false information, and lower agreeableness of the
   person encountering it, would predict their likelihood of extending its
   reach. One hundred and seventy-two participants saw real examples of
   disinformation stories that had been posted to social media and rated
   their likelihood of sharing and interacting with it in other ways.
   Neither trust in the source nor agreeableness influenced organic reach.
   However, people lower in conscientiousness rated themselves as more
   likely to extend its reach, as did people who believed the stories more
   likely to be true.}},

Abstract = {{The online dissemination of mis- and disinformation may pose vexing
   problems on democracy. The factual basis of (political) information may
   be challenged by opposed partisans or issue publics, and misinformation
   may impact decision-making as confirmation biases may outweigh accuracy
   motivations. In this setting, fact-checkers that refute the false claims
   of misinformation may be regarded as an important tool to combat
   misinformation. Yet, the effectiveness of corrective information may be
   contingent upon partisan lenses, or the framing used in misinformation.
   In this study, the effectiveness of fact-checkers that refute different
   forms of misinformation on the polarizing issue of crime rates related
   to anti-immigration framing was assessed in the US and Netherlands. The
   main findings indicate that exposure to fact-checkers can correct
   misperceptions on immigration, and lowers the credibility of
   misinformation. Fact-checkers are more effective in the Netherlands than
   the US. These findings have important ramifications for understanding
   citizens' susceptibility to (partisan) misinformation and rebuttals.}},

Abstract = {{Fakes news has become one of the main problems of our communicative
   ecosystem. Although this information usually leads to doubts or
   distortions of reality, during the health crisis caused by COVID-19 they
   have become an added problem by proposing and affirming to audiences
   forms of prevention, procedures or medicines that not only do not serve
   to prevent this disease, but can even be counterproductive or harmful.
   It is here that the detection of false news plays an essential role, as
   well as its subsequent verification. This study addresses this issue by
   identifying the tools that have been implemented by large technology
   companies to reduce and limit the spread of fakes news. To this end, the
   methodology focuses on the collection and analysis of these tools while
   the conclusions show that the processes followed by these companies that
   massively distribute information are based on the traditional pillars of
   journalism. Therefore, in a convulsive stage where media agitation and
   disinformation are rewarded, the value of traditional journalism is
   revalued.}},

Abstract = {{Since 2016, the European Commission has sought to take a proactive
   stance in addressing disinformation, with this stance evidently
   influenced by the divisive nature of disinformation and its ability to
   dissuade participation and trust in democratic institutions. Yet as the
   coronavirus pandemic brought fear and uncertainty to Europe and the
   wider world, how well equipped was the Commission's approach for the
   onslaught of health disinformation which accompanied the pandemic?
   Reflecting on the EU's soft law approach both before and after this
   `Infodemic,' this article critically analyses the inherent difficulties
   in regulating disinformation and looks ahead to the Commission's
   proposed approach into the future. Finally, considering these inherent
   regulatory difficulties and the impact of the Infodemic, this paper
   reflects upon the feasibility of a `consumer-centric' solution to
   tackling disinformation in the European Union.}},

   The study focuses on such media's framing of the Norwegian children
   social welfare system. The study aims to explain which typical Russian
   information warfare narratives were used in the Czech Republic. Using a
   content analysis with open and axial sociological coding, general
   narratives were identified. Then, the article focused on the emerging
   sub-narratives and their characteristics. The narrative of
   fascism/Nazism appeared to be very straightforward, it also used some
   Czech society specific sub-narratives. Narratives of twisted sexuality
   appeared to be the most uniform. Finally, the narrative of neo-Marxist
   policy has shown to be mostly using expressions such as social
   engineering and negative framing of modern left ideologies.}},

Abstract = {{The disinformation strategies of 12 extreme right-wing European parties
   through the narrative textual analysis of the contents shared by their
   official YouTube channels are analyzed. In order to achieve our goal, we
   analyze in the first place the discourse of the total number of videos
   hosted (12,961), and then, the precise meaning processes (staging,
   narrator system ...) on a sample of the 36 most shared and visited
   clips. We show that the vast majority of the parties build discourses
   based on the hate, visually supported on the figure of a single leader
   who appeals (through an analytical montage and the slowing down of the
   footage) to the resurrection of a privileged community based on the
   exclusion of the external subjects.}},

Abstract = {{Multiple state and non-state actors have recently used social media to
   conduct targeted disinformation operations for political effect. Even in
   the wake of these attacks, researchers struggle to fully understand
   these operations and more importantly measure their effect. The existing
   research is complicated by the fact that modeling and measuring a
   persons beliefs is difficult, and manipulating these beliefs in
   experimental settings is not morally permissible. Given these
   constraints, our team designed an Agent Based Model that is designed to
   allow researchers to explore various disinformation forms of maneuver in
   a virtual environment. This model mirrors the Twitter Social Media
   Environment and is grounded in social influence theory. Having built
   this model, we demonstrate its use in exploring two disinformation forms
   of maneuver: 1) ``backing{''} key influencers and 2) ``bridging{''} two
   communities.}},

Abstract = {{This paper analyses the narrative of disinformation disseminated through
   the social net-work TikTok, a network which is popular at a global level
   and whose users are mainly young or very young. To do so, a study was
   carried out on the content of publications on TikTok in four countries
   with different idiosyncrasies and national realities: Spain, Por-tugal,
   Brazil, and the United States. Interviews were also conducted with
   fact-checking agencies on the potential for misinformation and
   fact-checking potential on this social network. The results suggest that
   due to its characteristics as a fresh, visual network with easily
   shareable and viral content, TikTok is a network that facilitates the
   spread of disin-formation, but which in turn is a tool for debunking
   hoaxes beyond the range of action of conventional media.}},

Abstract = {{State and non-state actors leverage social media as a tool for hybrid
   warfare strategies. It becomes a psycho-political weapon aimed at the
   adversary's vulnerabilities exhibited in socio-politico-economic fault
   lines. Twitter, like other social media platforms, is being increasingly
   used to spread disinformation. Apart from verified accounts and social
   media teams, bots can be used to enhance a challenging situation for
   their own benefit. The challenge that many data analysts have is not
   finding the data only, but sorting through it to segregate fake from the
   real. Pakistan has been targeted continuously by disinformation. This
   paper discusses how influence campaigns have been waged over digital
   platforms in recent years, using Pakistan as a case study to highlight
   one of the existing fault lines and discuss opportunities in the context
   of the growing role of social media in modern warfare. It also tries to
   address the role of belligerent state actors in shaping the
   psychological makeup of democratic population. This research provides
   analysis into the worldwide influence operations and their role in
   international politics. It also provides insightful examinations of how
   democracies all over the world can overcome foreign manipulations.
   Finally, it is intended to aid analysts, scholars and policymakers for
   better understanding of information warfare in the context of cyber
   conflict.}},

   The following study explores IRA activity on three social media

   on these sites were temporally coordinated. Using a VAR analysis with
   Granger Causality tests, results show that IRA Reddit activity granger
   caused IRA Twitter activity within a one-week lag. One explanation may

   (i.e., Reddit) to figure out which messages are optimal to distribute on

   a case study and mixed-methods approach that combined an online data
   collection of content, spread, propagators, and interactions' analyses,
   with in-depth analysis of the meaning of such fake news. The results
   show that the most successful fake news about Lula capitalized on prior
   hostility toward him, several originated or were spread by conservative
   right-wing politicians and mainstream journalists, and that the pro-Lula
   fake news circulated in smaller networks and had overall less global

Year = {{2020}},

Abstract = {{As trust in news media and social media dwindles and fears of
   disinformation and echo chambers spread, individuals need to find ways
   to access and assess reliable and trustworthy information. Despite low
   levels of trust in social media, they are used for accessing political
   information and news. In this study, we examine the information
   verification practices of opinion leaders (who consume political
   information above average and share their opinions on social media above
   average) and of opinion seekers (who seek out political information from
   friends and family) to understand similarities and differences in their
   news media trust, fact-checking behaviors, and likeliness of being
   caught in echo chambers. Based on a survey of French Internet users (N =
   2,000) we find that not only opinion leaders, but also opinion seekers,
   have higher rates across all three of these dependent variables. We
   discuss the implications of findings for the development of opinion
   leadership theory as well as for social media platforms wishing to
   increase trust.}},

Title = {{Operational Disinformation of Soviet Counterintelligence during the Cold
   War}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENCE AND COUNTERINTELLIGENCE}},
Abstract = {{During the Cold War, the USSR (Soviet Union) and the United States were
   in a state of permanent political and thus information and psychological
   competition, conducted using various methods and forms of military and
   nonmilitary influence. This article analyzes doctrinal and textbook
   models of operational disinformation application from the
   counterintelligence service standpoint. Disinformation as a technique
   and tool of operational work was used in the area of intelligence
   influence within the operations and games conducted by the special
   services of the USSR. Still, it was also used in active operational
   combinations carried out by the State Committee for Security under the
   Council of Ministers of the USSR counterintelligence. The author's
   thesis is that operational disinformation had a significant impact on
   the activity and effectiveness of the Soviet defensive services, and
   these methodologies are still in the arsenal of the Russian Federal
   Security Service, Foreign Intelligence Service, and Main Intelligence
   Directorate.}},

Abstract = {{For decades, corporate undermining of scientific consensus has eroded
   the scientific process worldwide. Guardrails for protecting
   science-informed processes, from peer review to regulatory decision
   making, have suffered sustained attacks, damaging public trust in the
   scientific enterprise and its aim to serve the public good. Government
   efforts to address corporate attacks have been inadequate. Researchers
   have cataloged corporate malfeasance that harms people's health across
   diverse industries. Well-known cases, like the tobacco industry's
   efforts to downplay the dangers of smoking, are representative of
   transnational industries, rather than unique. This contribution
   schematizes industry tactics to distort, delay, or distract the public
   from instituting measures that improve health-tactics that comprise the
   ``disinformation playbook.{''} Using a United States policy lens, we
   outline steps the scientific community should take to shield science
   from corporate interference, through individual actions (by scientists,
   peer reviewers, and editors) and collective initiatives (by research
   institutions, grant organizations, professional associations, and
   regulatory agencies).}},

   trending topics on Twitter during the crisis. By using documentary
   analysis, critical discourse analysis and virtual ethnography techniques
   (non-participant observation), we concluded that, unlike fake news,
   hoaxes were generated by applying more sophisticated and complicated
   strategies to detect, especially due to image manipulation and their
   decontextualized use. Counter-hashtag, subverted discourse and activism
   were the catalysts for the main trending topics.}},

Title = {{Deepfakes, misinformation and disinformation and authenticity
   infrastructure responses: Impacts on frontline witnessing, distant
   witnessing, and civic journalism}},
Journal = {{JOURNALISM}},
Abstract = {{Frontline witnessing and civic journalism are impacted by the rhetoric
   and the reality of misinformation and disinformation. This essay
   highlights key insights from activities of the human rights and civic
   journalism network WITNESS, as they seek to prepare for new forms of
   media manipulation, such as deepfakes, and to ensure that an emergent
   ``authenticity infrastructure{''} is in place to respond to global needs
   for reliable information without creating additional harms. Based on
   global consultations on perceived threats and prioritized solutions,
   their efforts are primarily targeted towards synthetic media and
   deepfakes, which not only facilitate audiovisual falsification
   (including non-consensual sexual images) but also, by being embedded in
   societal dynamics of surveillance and civil society suppression, they
   challenge real footage and so undermine the credibility of civic media
   and frontline witnessing (also known as ``liar's dividend{''}). They do
   this within a global context where journalists and some distant witness
   investigators self-identify as lacking relevant skills and capacity, and
   face inequity in access to detection technologies. Within this context,
   ``authenticity infrastructure{''} tracks media provenance, integrity,
   and manipulation from camera to edit to distribution, and so comes to
   provide ``verification subsidies{''} that enable distant witnesses to
   properly interpret eye-witness footage. This ``authenticity
   infrastructure{''} and related tools are rapidly moving from niche to
   mainstream in the form of initiatives the Content Authenticity
   Initiative and Coalition for Content Authenticity and Provenance,
   raising key questions about who participates in the production and
   dissemination of audiovisual information, under what circumstances and
   to which effect for whom. Provenance risks being weaponized unless key
   concerns are integrated into infrastructure proposals and
   implementation. Data may be used against vulnerable witnesses, or the
   absence of a trail, for legitimate privacy and technological access
   reasons, used to undermine credibility. Regulatory and extra-legal
   co-option are also a fear as securitized ``fake news{''} laws
   proliferate. The investigation of both phenomena, deepfakes and emergent
   authenticity infrastructure(s), this paper argues, is important as it
   highlights the risks related both to the ``information disorder{''} of
   deepfakes as they challenge the credibility and safety of frontline
   witnesses and to responses to such ``disorder,{''} as they risk
   worsening inequities in access to tools for mitigation or increasing
   exposure to harms from technology infrastructure.}},

Number = {{4}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The work of libraries during the COVID-19 pandemic, as facilitators of
   reliable information on health issues, has shown that these entities can
   play an active role as verification agents in the fight against
   disinformation (false information that is intended to mislead), focusing
   on media and informational literacy. To help citizens, these entities
   have developed a wide range of actions that range from online seminars,
   to learning how to evaluate the quality of a source, to video tutorials
   or the creation of repositories with resources of various natures. To
   identify the most common media literacy practices in the face of fake
   news (news that conveys or incorporates false, fabricated, or
   deliberately misleading information), this exploratory study designed an
   ad hoc analysis sheet, validated by the inter-judge method, which
   allowed one to classify the practices of N = 216 libraries from all over
   the world. The results reveal that the libraries most involved in this
   task are those belonging to public universities. Among the actions
   carried out to counteract misinformation, open-access materials that
   favor self-learning stand out. These resources, aimed primarily at
   university students and adults in general, are aimed at acquiring skills
   related to fact-checking and critical thinking. Therefore, libraries
   vindicate their role as components of the literacy triad, together with
   professors and communication professionals.}},

Journal = {{OSMANLI ARASTIRMALARI-THE JOURNAL OF OTTOMAN STUDIES}},
Year = {{2014}},

Abstract = {{The Ottoman-Habsburg war of 1663-1664 was a struggle of military units
   fighting for two rival dynasties against each other as well as against
   the coercive technological limits in the XVIIth century. In terms of
   military efficiency, vital issues such as intelligence gathering and
   passing of orders among military units remained a somewhat unsolved
   problem due to apparent communication difficulties. Early modern
   military structures thus had to cope with false and unwarranted news
   which could easily affect the fighting spirit of troops. In a prolonged
   campaign season the common soldier became more and more exposed to
   rumors and hearsays in the military camp and tended to believe them much
   easier by each passing day. And because of similar communication
   hardships it took a rather long time for central administrations to
   correct a false piece of news circulating within the military camp and
   even beyond. Ottoman and Habsburg armies fighting along the Hungarian
   frontier in 1663-1664 were no exception to the rule. The existence of
   opposing personalities within both the Ottoman and Habsburg military who
   sought to use the ``circulating disinformation{''} to their own
   political ends reveals a rather vague conflict between the leading
   actors of military enterprise and a group of discontents. In this
   respect, the ways by which the army members and a large body of people
   keeping an eye on the possible outcomes of the war dealt with false
   news, disinformation, and rumors without foundation could serve as
   explanatory examples on the nature of early modern political power.}},

Year = {{2022}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{DEC 31}},
Abstract = {{This study investigated the effect of media and information literacy
   (MIL) on the ability to identify fake news, disinformation and
   misinformation, and sharing intentions. The experimental approach was
   selected to study both the control group and experimental group made up
   of a total of 187 respondents. Comparative analysis of the two groups
   revealed that although more respondents in the experimental group were
   able to identify the inauthenticity of information presented to them,
   some of the respondents in the control group were also able to do the
   same, even though they did not receive MIL training. Conversely, some
   respondents in the experimental group, even though they were trained in
   MIL, could not determine the inauthenticity of information, possibly
   because the one-off training given to them did not allow them to
   assimilate all the information in one sitting. Nonetheless, the results
   of the bivariate correlation computation showed that MIL trained
   respondents were more likely to determine authenticity or otherwise of
   information and less likely to share inaccurate stories. This means that
   when MIL increases, sharing of fake news decreases. This is yet another
   evidence that MIL enables information consumers to make informed
   judgments about quality information. It is recommended that MIL is
   incorporated into mainstream educational modules and consistently
   revised to reflect the demands of the times. MIL programs must also
   consider how to effectively reach those without formal education. Actors
   within the information, communications, and media ecology must
   contribute to their quota in making information consumers more
   discerning with the right MIL sensitisation.}},

Abstract = {{While disinformation through social media has emerged as a new form of
   information operations for countries to advance their strategic
   interests, there is a lack of studies examining its adverse impacts. By
   grounding the discussion on the agenda-building theory, we theorize the
   relationships among four key variables of interest, namely, (1) foreign
   disinformation through social media, (2) domestic online media
   fractionalization, (3) government?s control over cyberspace, and (4)
   social media-induced offline violence in a country. A quantitative
   analysis based on publicly available archival data offers support for
   our research model. Specifically, our findings indicate that foreign
   disinformation through social media increases social media-induced
   offline violence in a country by increasing its domestic online media
   fractionalization. Further, our results highlight that the relationships
   among foreign disinformation through social media, social media-induced
   offline violence, and domestic online media fractionalization in a
   country are contingent on the government?s role in controlling its
   cyberspace. Implications of our findings to research and practice are
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The growing use of social media leads to a growing public engagement
   with professional questions and issues. During the period of Covid-19
   pandemic, a large number of non-expert people participate in the
   discussion on the virus and official intervention process. These people
   are more likely to be influenced by Covid-19 disinformation and lose
   their trust in government. As one of the first countries suffered from
   Covid-19, China has been faced with this serious ``infodemic{''}. In
   this context, government agencies in China adopted the four-stages
   strategies (immediate response, diagnosis, reforming interventions and
   evaluation) on social media to weaken the impact of disinformation and
   repair public trust. Based on the structural equation model (SEM), this
   study constructs a research model to statistically test the roles of the
   four-stages strategies on public trust repair in China. The findings
   reveal that each media strategy shows positive impact on citizens'
   perception of their government. From the lesson in China, it is
   suggested that government agencies need constantly cooperate with a wide
   range of social organizations to ensure the greater voice on social
   media. Also, it is necessary to regularize the four-stage strategies on
   social media as a whole system to mitigate the spread of disinformation
   and improve public attitudes toward government.}},

   Fearmonger. Within each type, accounts were used consistently, but the
   behavior across types was different, both in terms of ``normal{''} daily
   behavior and in how they responded to external events. In this sense,
   the Internet Research Agency's agenda-building effort was

Title = {{So What if They're Lying to Us? Comparing Rhetorical Strategies for
   Discrediting Sources of Disinformation and Misinformation Using an
   Affect-Based Credibility Rating}},
Journal = {{AMERICAN BEHAVIORAL SCIENTIST}},
Abstract = {{Despite growing research on false information, a theoretical framework
   to organize findings is lacking. We use affect control theory to fill
   this need and introduce the affect-based credibility rating for
   interpreting the effectiveness of rhetorical strategies in discrediting
   the source of falsehoods. The rating quantifies the difference in
   connotations between the labels used to characterize the source and an
   ideal, credible source. Successful discrediting amplifies the
   difference. We use the rating to compare rhetorical strategies for
   discrediting opponents as sources during rival information campaigns
   about the Equal Rights Amendment. We show claiming the opponent is
   spreading disinformation rather than misinformation (stating the
   opponent is spreading falsehoods deliberately, rather than unwittingly)
   appears more effective at discrediting, particularly when disinformation
   claims allege more sinister motives for lying. The new rating helps
   organize findings by enabling direct comparisons between strategies,
   thereby contributing toward efforts to detect and discredit falsehoods
   in media.}},

Abstract = {{Disinformation continues to raise concerns due to its increasing threat
   to society. Nevertheless, a threat of a disinformation-based attack on
   critical infrastructure is often overlooked. Here, we consider urban
   traffic networks and focus on fake information that manipulates drivers'
   decisions to create congestion at a city scale. Specifically, we
   consider two complementary scenarios, one where drivers are persuaded to
   move towards a given location, and another where they are persuaded to
   move away from it. We study the optimization problem faced by the
   adversary when choosing which streets to target to maximize disruption.
   We prove that finding an optimal solution is computationally
   intractable, implying that the adversary has no choice but to settle for
   suboptimal heuristics. We analyze one such heuristic, and compare the
   cases when targets are spread across the city of Chicago vs.
   concentrated in its business district. Surprisingly, the latter results
   in more far-reaching disruption, with its impact felt as far as 2 km
   from the closest target. Our findings demonstrate that vulnerabilities
   in critical infrastructure may arise not only from hardware and
   software, but also from behavioral manipulation.}},

Pages = {{841+}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{This article explores the transformative role of practices of countering
   digital disinformation in European Union diplomacy. It argues that an
   overlooked dimension of the change brought by the rise of digital
   disinformation is located in the emergence of everyday countering
   practices. Efforts to counter disinformation have led to the recruitment
   of new actors with different dispositions and skill sets than those of
   traditional diplomats and state officials in diplomatic organizations
   such as the European External Action Service. Focusing on the countering
   efforts by the East StratCom Task Force, a unit introduced in 2015, the
   article argues that the composition of actors, the task force's
   practices and the reorientation in audience perception it reflected,
   contributed significantly to institutional transformation. Drawing on 23
   interviews with key actors and building on recent advancements in
   international practice theory, the article shows how change and
   transformation can be studied in practices that have resulted from
   digitalization in international politics. The article thus contributes
   to an increased understanding of the digitalization of diplomacy in
   which new practices can emerge from both deliberate reflection and
   experimentation.}},

Abstract = {{The weaponization of digital communications and social media to conduct
   disinformation campaigns at immense scale, speed, and reach presents new
   challenges to identify and counter hostile influence operations (IOs).
   This paper presents an end-to-end framework to automate detection of

   framework integrates natural language processing, machine learning,
   graph analytics, and a network causal inference approach to quantify the
   impact of individual actors in spreading IO narratives. We demonstrate
   its capability on real-world hostile IO campaigns with Twitter datasets
   collected during the 2017 French presidential elections and known IO
   accounts disclosed by Twitter over a broad range of IO campaigns (May
   2007 to February 2020), over 50,000 accounts, 17 countries, and
   different account types including both trolls and bots. Our system
   detects IO accounts with 96\% precision, 79\% recall, and 96\%
   area-under-the precision-recall (P-R) curve; maps out salient network
   communities; and discovers high-impact accounts that escape the lens of
   traditional impact statistics based on activity counts and network

   IO accounts from US Congressional reports, investigative journalism, and

   collected a large-scale dataset of tweets associated to thousands of
   news articles published on Italian disinformation websites. In the
   observation period, a few outlets accounted for most of the deceptive
   information circulating on Twitter, which focused on controversial and
   polarizing topics of debate such as immigration, national safety and
   (Italian) nationalism. We found evidence of connections between Italian
   disinformation sources and different disinformation outlets across
   Europe, U.S. and Russia, featuring similar, even translated, articles in
   the period before the elections. Overall, the spread of disinformation
   on Twitter was confined in a limited community, strongly (and
   explicitly) related to the Italian conservative and far-right political
   environment, who had a limited impact on online discussions on the

Abstract = {{Deep concerns about the rise in the number of technological innovations
   used for perpetrating viral dissemination of disinformation, via major
   social media platforms during multiparty elections, have been expressed.
   As strategy scholars observe, it is inimical to democratic systems whose
   election results are questioned by reason of faulty electoral processes.
   The Marxian alienation theory and Marilyn's ex-post facto research
   designs were used for evaluating the consequences of adopting political
   disinformation strategies (PDS) as tools for manipulation, via
   innovative artificial intelligent technologies, on established social
   media networks during recent democratic elections in the US and other
   rising hegemonies. The study observed that most governments and expert
   political campaigners continue to find it a politically viable platform
   suitable for swinging the votes of electorates in desired directions.
   Authors recommended stiffer regulations for media platforms and party
   agents as this would aid discontinuing the practice of PDS during
   elections in established and rising hegemonies.}},

Abstract = {{We report the results of a preregistered study that tested the
   effectiveness of inoculating participants against Islamophobic and
   radical-Islamist disinformation. Participants in the experimental
   (inoculation) condition watched a video that explained common rhetorical
   markers of radical-Islamist and Islamophobic disinformation that had
   been identified in an analysis of YouTube content. The information was
   presented in a neutral context not involving Islam and focused on
   analysis of the misleading argumentation. The control group watched a
   video about an unrelated topic. Participants were then exposed to target
   videos with ``gateway{''} content that constituted an entry point to
   potential Islamist or Islamophobic radicalization. Both videos contained
   numerous items of disinformation. Participants then answered a variety
   of questions such as how likely they were to share the video, their
   level of agreement, and their perceived accuracy of the video.
   Participants who had received the inoculation displayed less agreement
   with the video content, perceived the video as less reliable, and were
   less likely to share it in comparison with participants in the control
   group. The study provides support for the use of argument-based
   inoculation in combatting extremist messages.}},

Title = {{How weaponizing disinformation can bring down a city's power grid}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG 12}},
Abstract = {{Social media has made it possible to manipulate the masses via
   disinformation and fake news at an unprecedented scale. This is
   particularly alarming from a security perspective, as humans have proven
   to be one of the weakest links when protecting critical infrastructure
   in general, and the power grid in particular. Here, we consider an
   attack in which an adversary attempts to manipulate the behavior of
   energy consumers by sending fake discount notifications encouraging them
   to shift their consumption into the peak-demand period. Using Greater
   London as a case study, we show that such disinformation can indeed lead
   to unwitting consumers synchronizing their energy-usage patterns, and
   result in blackouts on a city-scale if the grid is heavily loaded. We
   then conduct surveys to assess the propensity of people to
   follow-through on such notifications and forward them to their friends.
   This allows us to model how the disinformation may propagate through
   social networks, potentially amplifying the attack impact. These
   findings demonstrate that in an era when disinformation can be
   weaponized, system vulnerabilities arise not only from the hardware and
   software of critical infrastructure, but also from the behavior of the
   consumers.}},

Title = {{HeadlineStanceChecker: Exploiting summarization to detect headline
   disinformation}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF WEB SEMANTICS}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{71}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The headline of a news article is designed to succinctly summarize its
   content, providing the reader with a clear understanding of the news
   item. Unfortunately, in the post-truth era, headlines are more focused
   on attracting the reader's attention for ideological or commercial
   reasons, thus leading to mis- or disinformation through false or
   distorted headlines. One way of combating this, although a challenging
   task, is by determining the relation between the headline and the body
   text to establish the stance. Hence, to contribute to the detection of
   mis- and disinformation, this paper proposes an approach
   (HeadlineStanceChecker) that determines the stance of a headline with
   respect to the body text to which it is associated. The novelty rests on
   the use of a two-stage classification architecture that uses
   summarization techniques to shape the input for both classifiers instead
   of directly passing the full news body text, thereby reducing the amount
   of information to be processed while keeping important information.
   Specifically, summarization is done through Positional Language Models
   leveraging on semantic resources to identify salient information in the
   body text that is then compared to its corresponding headline. The
   results obtained show that our approach achieves 94.31\% accuracy for
   the overall classification and the best FNC-1 relative score compared
   with the state of the art. It is especially remarkable that the system,
   which uses only the relevant information provided by the automatic
   summaries instead of the whole text, is able to classify the different
   stance categories with very competitive results, especially in the
   discuss stance between the headline and the news body text. It can be
   concluded that using automatic extractive summaries as input of our
   approach together with the two-stage architecture is an appropriate
   solution to the problem. (C) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier

Title = {{Disinformation as COVID-19's Twin Pandemic: False Equivalences,
   Entrenched Epistemologies, and Causes-of-Causes}},
Journal = {{OMICS-A JOURNAL OF INTEGRATIVE BIOLOGY}},
Abstract = {{We are currently facing and traversing in the thick of a twin pandemic:
   coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and disinformation. Disinformation
   is false information created and spread deliberately with the intention
   to mislead public opinion, obscure truths, and undermine trust in
   knowledge. The digital age we live in is quite different than the
   printing revolution and invention of the oil-based ink printing press
   centuries ago. Digital technologies can spread and repeat disinformation
   at extremely high speeds, while anyone, a qualified expert or not, and
   with internet access, can become an author. To fight disinformation, we
   ought to dismantle the entrenched and extractive epistemologies that act
   as upstream drivers and sites of disinformation production. Epistemology
   refers to the value-laden knowledge frames, overarching master
   narratives, and storylines, in which knowledge is produced. If the
   epistemologies in which we generate knowledge are false, then the
   knowledge products will be laden with disinformation. Moreover, the
   harms caused by disinformation can extend well beyond the immediate
   knowledge domain where disinformation has originated. This occurs when
   ``false equivalence{''} is used as a form of rhetoric. False equivalence
   is a type of flawed sense making where equal weight is given to
   arguments with concrete material evidence, and those that are
   conjecture, untrue, or unjust. This article presents an analysis of the
   disinformation pandemic attendant to COVID-19, with an eye to its
   causes-of-causes: unchecked extractive epistemologies (e.g.,
   technocracy), and the practice of false equivalence in pandemic
   discourses. We argue that holding the political agency of master
   narratives to account is essential (1) to fight the disinformation
   pandemic and (2) for prefigurative politics to build egalitarian and
   democratic societies in place of the instrumental/transactional
   relationships that typify the contemporary nation states and the
   neoliberal university whose ossified rituals lack the normative
   capacities for critical governance in a time of converging social,
   digital, and ecological crises. For liberation from disinformation, we
   should start with liberation from entrenched extractive epistemologies
   in science and society.}},

Abstract = {{Disinformation on the Internet has become a major threat to our society.
   Especially false and inaccurate information in the form of news might
   have detrimental consequences for the democratic process when biasing
   individuals' political views. To combat disinformation, a necessary
   first step is to investigate the factors relevant for individuals to
   detected false information online. Hence, we conducted an experiment (N
   = 294) to investigate effects of message factors and individual
   differences on individuals' credibility and accuracy perceptions of
   disinformation as well as on their likelihood of sharing them. Results
   suggest that message factors, such as the source, inconsistencies,
   subjectivity, sensationalism, or manipulated images, seem less important
   for users' evaluations of disinformation articles than individual
   differences. While need for cognition seems most relevant for accuracy
   perceptions, the opinion toward the news topic seems most crucial for
   whether people believe in the news and share it online.}},

Abstract = {{Rapid technological advancement is changing the way that political
   parties, voters, and media platforms engage with each other. This along
   with cultural change has led to an emerging era of disinformation and
   misinformation driven by both domestic and foreign actors. Political
   deepfakes, videos created through the use of artificial intelligence,
   allow individuals to rapidly create fake videos indistinguishable from
   true content. These videos have the capacity to undermine voter trust
   and could alter electoral outcomes. Regulating disinformation however
   raises significant free speech concerns, as well as questions about
   where liability should fall. In particular, holding large technology and
   media platforms accountable for content could lead to unintended
   chilling effects around freedom of expression, harming rather than
   protecting democratic institutions. Proposed regulations should
   therefore be carefully analysed through the framework of the implied
   freedom of political communication, ensuring that any new laws are
   proportionate and tailored to the threat they seek to prevent. This
   article analyses how current Australian law interacts with political
   deepfakes and proposes two targeted amendments to our federal electoral
   regulations to reduce the threat they pose to elections.}},

Abstract = {{Because of a recent politically-biased Lancet editorial, the world's
   opinion has been directed against the Brazilian government over the
   rising numbers of COVID-19 cases in the country. This is an example of
   reporting data without accounting for important covariates.
   Epidemiological figures should always be corrected for population size.
   In fact, Brazil is not even on the list of the 10 countries with the
   highest number of deaths per 100,000 people. Belgium, the United
   Kingdom, and Spain are the most affected countries in this regard. The
   disinformation presented by a renowned medical journal has ignited
   severe criticisms against a Chief-of-State for not promoting a
   generalized lockdown in a country of continental size. As scientists, we
   have a duty to stress the caveats of science instead of fueling
   political attacks, and we should refrain from jumping to uninformed
   conclusions without considering well-analyzed data. Moreover, while
   there is no evidence to endorse the efficacy of a generalized lockdown
   in socioeconomically vulnerable populations, it is undoubtedly
   associated with severe nationwide adverse effects.}},

Abstract = {{This research addresses the use of individual protection, overarching
   protection, and disinformation to defend a series system against
   intentional attacks. The attacker can allocate resources to intelligence
   actions to distinguish false targets from genuine targets. Analogously,
   the defender can expend efforts on disinformation actions to prevent the
   false targets from being detected. The probability that a target is
   detected depends on the effort exerted by both parties. In this defense
   and attack model, the defender moves first and allocates its resources
   to overarching protection, disinformation actions, and individual
   protection to minimize system destruction probability, assuming that the
   attacker has full knowledge of its actions and will always employ the
   most harmful attack strategy. The attacker allocates its resources to
   overarching protection penetration, intelligence actions, and individual
   attacks to maximize system destruction probability. We formulate the
   defense and attack model as a two-stage minmax game and analyze the
   optimal defense strategy. The proposed model is illustrated by a
   signaling system. This study demonstrates how the defender and attacker
   should respond under different contest intensities and amounts of
   resources.}},

Abstract = {{This article explores the role of rumor in late Jacobean court politics.
   It argues that misinformation and disinformation were not incidental to
   the jostling for power and the interplay of faction that took place at
   court, but were instead major political forces, capable of affecting the
   fortunes of even the most powerful courtiers. Perception, as this
   article demonstrates, was everything at court, since false rumors that
   individual courtiers would be granted offices or would soon fall from
   power had a self-fulfilling potential. While contemporaries were quick
   to assume that rumors were spread deliberately, this paper demonstrates
   that such false reports were sometimes mere speculation and wishful
   thinking passed on as fact. False rumors made decisions about court
   appointments or the disgrace of ministers much more of a collective act,
   and much less the preserve of the king, than historians have hitherto
   realized.}},

   formed part of a sophisticated propaganda strategy employed by the
   parliamentarian war party, aimed at discrediting Charles I during the
   first months of the conflict. It therefore offers an important
   corrective to traditional emphases on the anxieties that partisan print
   engendered. Furthermore, by showing that this strategy drew on both the
   practices and texts associated with early Stuart scribal opposition to
   Caroline rule, the article suggests an important link between pre-war

   Comparative Analysis between Spain and United Kingdom}},

Abstract = {{The current media ecosystem, derived from the consolidation of
   Information and Communication Technologies, shows a scenario in which
   the relationship between the media and their audience is being
   redefined. This represents a challenge for journalistic practice. In the
   digital age, the public actively participates in the construction and
   dissemination of news through social networks. Faced with this loss of
   control by the media, fake news and disinformation are emerging as one
   of the main problems of journalistic practice in a competitive business
   context, and with a high saturation of news content. In this situation,
   fact checkers emerge as key players in the information verification
   process. This research comparatively analyses the main fact checkers in
   Spain and the United Kingdom through content analysis applied to their
   corporate websites to understand their characteristics and working
   methodologies. The results underline that they are concerned with the
   concepts of transparency and honesty, along with showing their funding
   streams. The rigorousness of the verification process also stands out,
   as well as the importance of dialogue with the audience in their work.
   While in Spain they are featured by their non-profit nature and their
   international coverage, UK fact checkers focus on national information
   and are sometimes conceived as a business.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this research is to analyze the use of Twitter by Verificado
   Mexico during the Mexican electoral campaign of 2018. The project, known
   as VerificadoMX 2018, brought together a team of more than 90 media
   outlets and organizations that partnered to verify information about an
   electoral process that began on March 29 and ended on June 27, 2018.
   Based on the analysis of the 3116 tweets published from VerificadoMx's
   Twitter account, a typology of rumors and verifications is proposed for
   the study of electoral campaigns. From the study of the VerificadoMX
   Twitter account we must point out that we must distinguish two specific
   moments that accelerate the verification of facts and speeches: the
   electoral debates and the electoral day. On the other hand, we can
   differentiate between rumors of electoral pre-campaign, campaign and
   post-campaign.}},

   USFDA Warning Letters}},
Journal = {{HEALTH COMMUNICATION}},
Abstract = {{COVID-19 poses a challenge beyond the virus itself, in that lockdown has
   been associated increased use of the internet and social media.
   Disinformation about prevention and treatment strategies for COVID-19
   can have lethal consequences. The United States Food and Drug
   Administration (USFDA) is currently monitoring the compliance of
   manufacturing firms as well as medicinal product advertisers to the
   Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 21 USC </n> 321(h) regulations. In
   the event of noncompliance in the form of advertising products without
   prior USFDA approval for specific indications, doses, or route of
   administration, warning letters (WLs) are issued. WLs are intended to
   address the concerns identified by USFDA and encourage the recipient to
   take corrective steps to avoid similar instances in the future. We
   analyzed 182 WLs that were issued for noncompliance with drugs/devices
   related to either treatment, prevention, or testing of COVID-19
   infections. The medicinal product website was identified as the major
   source of disinformation, followed by disseminated information on
   Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. Nearly four-fifths were related to
   drugs, followed by devices and biologicals. Several biologicals, as well
   as allopathic, herbal, and non-herbal drugs were identified in the WLs.
   We observed that noncompliance with the USFDA regulations in terms of
   advertising a variety of products for prevention and treatment of
   COVID-19 infection was widely prevalent. More efforts are required by
   the respective national drug regulatory authorities to initiate or
   continue their monitoring of disinformation that may have lethal
   consequences.}},

Abstract = {{Action against disinformation has become more important than ever in the
   context of the Covid-19 pandemic. This is due to the synchronous global
   scale of the problem and its potentially deadlier consequences as the
   public seeks out guidance regarding what they might do to lower the risk

   crisis on the regulation of social media platforms as it is mediated by
   the legacy of previous responses to disinformation. It shows that the
   Covid-19 crisis has catalyzed the shift to co-regulatory approaches that
   imposed reporting obligations on platforms at the European level. It
   also raises concerns about the implementation of the new European
   regulatory package that will largely depend on the initiatives of
   individual Member States such as Italy, where the low level of societal
   resilience to disinformation increases the incentives for political
   leaders to ignore the problem of disinformation.}},

   Consisting of 40 news-style articles, the data was used to find out how
   a conspiracy theory about the virus being a possible man-made bioweapon
   was presented to the audience. The results indicate that the rhizomatic
   structure of COVID-19 conspiracy theories makes it possible to vary the
   narratives based on the platform where it is published and the target
   audience. Information spreads in unexpected ways, and it is difficult to
   control or predict the spread of extremist content. This makes it
   possible for different actors, governments, and organizations to use
   information for their own purposes as a weapon of information warfare.}},

Abstract = {{Competition for social influence is a major force shaping societies,
   from baboons guiding their troop in different directions, to politicians
   combting for voters, to influancers competing for attention on social
   media. Social influence is invariably a competitive exercise with
   multiple influencers competing for it. We study which strategy maximizes
   social influence under competition. Applying game theory to a scenario
   where two advisers compete for the attention of a client, we find that
   the rational solution for advisers is to communicate truthfully when
   favored by the client, but to lie when ignored. Across seven
   pre-registered studies, testing 802 participants, such a strategic
   adviser consistently outcompeted an honest adviser. Strategic dishonesty
   outperformed truth-telling in swaying individual voters, the majority
   vote in anonymously voting groups, and the consensus vote in
   communicating groups. Our findings help explain the success of political
   movements that thrive on disinformation, and vocal underdog politicians
   with no credible program.}},

Abstract = {{The Cold War was an intelligence war, waged by the Soviets with a

   strike against Western values, heroes, and institutions. They
   aggressively used it to spread atheism into the highly Catholic nations

   including Cardinals Wyszynski of Poland. Mindszenty of Hungary, and
   Stepinac of Croatia, were among the earliest targets. Eventually, even
   the wartime pontiff Pius XII, was falsely portrayed. Whereas the false
   depictions, created for political reasons, do harm to truth, the Church,
   and mankind, faith in the Church's teachings has been a source of great
   strength. for many who have been subjected to disinformation. In a world
   where Christianity is often under assault, those who can distinguish

Abstract = {{The aim of this research is to study the processes of disinformation
   that circulated during the Uruguayan presidential elections of 2019. To
   do this, the role of the collaborative project of fact-checking
   Verificado Uruguay is studied. Our research establishes a typology of
   political hoaxes that were spread during this campaign and aims to point
   out their origin and motivations.
   It also shows that although there are regional narratives, local
   contexts make it impossible to establish parallels between the Uruguayan
   presidential campaign and others in Latin America that occurred
   simultaneously, such as Argentina. Finally, the research highlights the
   importance of the type of candidate and party or coalition when it comes
   to fostering a culture of disinformation.}},

Abstract = {{The theoretical study deals with fake news, disinformation and hoaxes.
   These phenomena are a major problem for contemporary society. We call it
   post-factual society. This expression is explained as falling confidence
   in objective facts and, on the contrary, increasing confidence in
   information with an emotional connotation, based on personal belief and
   conviction. The author in the study discusses the concepts of fake news,
   misinformation, hoaxes, their types, properties, and analyses several
   known fake news that appear primarily on the Internet. The author
   further analyses the current situation and interprets the results of the
   Media Literacy Index 2018, which deals with the resistance of the
   countries to the aforementioned negative phenomena. Last, but not least,
   the author focuses on the possibilities of prevention, education in this
   field and increasing media literacy. The study presents a theoretical
   view of the problem that has resonated in recent years in society and
   requires preventive measures and activities in the field of education

Abstract = {{Although authoritarian states have expanded their tools to surveil
   citizens and spread disinformation, we know little about how political
   lawyers have mobilized to resist such covert strategies. Based on
   semi-structured interviews with Russian lawyers and open-government
   consultants, this article examines how political lawyers oppose three
   emerging authoritarian tactics of the Russian government: running
   disinformation campaigns by ``troll factories,{''} wiretapping, and
   hiding information on government activities and public services. I find
   that, despite the repressive legal environment, lawyers have
   considerable success in developing legal and nonlegal strategies to hold
   government to account. As autocrats rely on information control to
   portray themselves as capable leaders, political lawyers and
   open-government consultants use audits and rankings to undermine
   political reputations. These findings from Russia may be broadly
   applicable to new authoritarian states in general.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding manipulated media, from automatically generated
   `deepfakes' to manually edited ones, raises novel research challenges.
   Because the vast majority of edited or manipulated images are benign,
   such as photoshopped images for visual enhancements, the key challenge
   is to understand the complex layers of underlying intents of media edits
   and their implications with respect to disinformation.
   In this paper, we study Edited Media Understanding Frames, a new
   conceptual formalism to understand visual media manipulation as
   structured annotations with respect to the intents, emotional reactions,
   effects on individuals, and the overall implications of disinformation.
   We introduce a dataset for our task, EMU, with 56k question-answer pairs
   written in rich natural language. We evaluate a wide variety of
   vision-and-language models for our task, and introduce a new model
   PELICAN, which builds upon recent progress in pretrained multimodal
   representations. Our model obtains promising results on our dataset,
   with humans rating its answers as accurate 48.2\% of the time. At the
   same time, there is still much work to be done - and we provide analysis
   that highlights areas for further progress.}},

Abstract = {{This paper aims to evaluate the role of social networks in the process
   of digital disinformation, which is used by the language of populist
   discourses, and catalyzed by the stigmatization of the traditional
   press. It is adopted as a hypothesis the joint use, by the social
   networks, of a curation of content and a qualitative improvement of
   their behavior, a hypothesis that aims to submit to an attempt to
   falsify, through a hypothetical-deductive methodology. Therefore, the
   concepts of disinformation and post-digital truth, as well as the habits
   that characterize this phenomenon, began to be addressed. In sequence,
   the work addresses populist practices, demonstrating their interactions
   with audience democracy and identifying that the press is, in these
   discourses, identified as part of the ``elites{''} and, thus, considered
   an enemy. Once the relationships between the instruments that propagate
   digital misinformation and the feedback of the populist phenomenon have
   been verified, the work goes on to assess the repercussions of the
   positions proposed as a hypothesis for social networks, concluding that
   such measures become adequate responses to the risks arising from
   electoral populism, because they are moderate solutions, which reduce
   digital antagonism.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SOCIAL HISTORY}},

Volume = {{55}},

Pages = {{65-84}},
Month = {{FAL}},
Abstract = {{This article identifies how and why Argentine political rumors were
   created, spread, and legitimized by government officials, military
   officers and the press in the interwar years. In that period, the
   practice of what we now call ``fake news{''}-known as pescado podrido
   (rotten fish) in Argentina for it poisons the one who hears or repeats
   it-became more common and took on international proportions. In
   Argentina, a variety of forces drove the increase in disinformation,
   including political instability, the rising (and later the banning) of
   the majoritarian Radical Party, elite anxiety about the threat of
   communism, and a long-lasting nationalist fear about the integrity of
   borders. Authorities and right-wing politicians were inclined to see any
   anti-government actions as linked to international communism and, in

   studies: One refers to the anti-Radical Party rumors, especially those
   spread in the days immediately before and after the coup d'etat in 1930;
   and the other to a more generalized atmosphere of anti-communist
   inspired rumors and fake news in the interwar period. This article is

   Patagonian cities, Buenos Aires, and Washington, D.C. Argentine official

Abstract = {{Twitter's 2018 release of its data corpus on Iran- and Russia-backed
   accounts provided an opportunity to examine whether emotion-laden tweets
   reached a wider audience than nonemotional tweets in the first
   large-scale attempt to interfere in the US presidential election in
   2016. We contrasted the dimensional and discrete theories of emotion by
   comparing tweets' virality as a function of their valence or discrete
   emotional content. While both perspectives were supported by the
   popularity of positive and joyful tweets, the unpopularity of negative
   and fearful tweets uniquely supported the discrete view. The robustness
   of this theoretically insightful finding was checked by applying a set
   of keywords from the Department of Homeland Security to identify tweets
   that were both negative and fear-evoking. Iranian and Russian
   disinformation operatives seemed unaware of negative and fearful tweets'
   unpopularity and composed most posts with these sentiments. This study's
   findings explored the digital extensions of two emotion theories and
   balanced the prevailing media reporting on foreign disinformation
   operations' sophistication.}},

Abstract = {{There has been much debate in recent years about the role of the East
   German Ministry for State Security (Stasi) in the disinformation
   campaign launched in the early 1980s by the Soviet State Security
   Committee (KGB) regarding the origin and nature of acquired immune
   deficiency syndrome (AIDS). The KGB's operation, codenamed ``Denver{''}
   by the Stasi (not ``Infektion,{''} as many online sources now
   erroneously assert), claimed that AIDS was deliberately devised by U.S.
   biological warfare specialists for the U.S. government to spread in
   minority communities in the United States. Based on the available
   evidence, the Stasi's role in the AIDS disinformation campaign was
   limited in 1985-1986 to (1) keeping watch over Soviet-East German
   scientist Jakob Segal, who propagated a variant of the KGB's thesis; (2)
   helping to arrange for the publication and distribution of a brochure
   with Segal's thesis at the Non-Aligned Movement summit in Harare in
   1986; and (3) facilitating Segal's interviews with certain journalists.
   Just as important for the ongoing formulation and spread of the KGB's
   AIDS disinformation was a cycle of misinformation and disinformation
   that arose between U.S.-based conspiracy theorists-especially Lyndon
   LaRouche and his followers-and authors and publications espousing
   Moscow's preferred theses regarding AIDS.}},

Abstract = {{The extreme growth and adoption of Social Media, in combination with
   their poor governance and the lack of quality control over the digital
   content being published and shared, has led information veracity to a
   continuous deterioration. Current approaches entrust content
   verification to a single centralised authority, lack resilience towards
   attempts to successfully ``game{''} verification checks, and make
   content verification difficult to access and use. In response, our
   ambition is to create an open, democratic, pluralistic and distributed
   ecosystem that allows easy access to various verification services (both
   internal and third-party), ensuring scalability and establishing trust
   in a completely decentralized environment. In fact, this is the ambition
   of the EU H2020 SocialTruth project. In this paper, we present the
   innovative project approach and the vision of effective online
   disinformation detection for various practical use-cases.}},

Abstract = {{This paper examines Soviet Cold War disinformation activity in India. It
   recovers the importance of nonaligned nations in the story of Cold War
   covert propaganda. Over the course of a decade, that began with the
   outbreak of the Sino-Indian border war in 1962, and culminated in the
   Indo-Pakistan conflict of 1971, India disengaged from the West, and
   tilted towards the Eastern bloc. In the process, New Delhi struggled to
   control diplomatic fallout from a covert propaganda conflict waged on
   its territory between the Soviet Union and the United States that, at
   times, threatened to imperil a strategic reorientation in India's
   foreign policy. This article privileges the significance of hitherto
   neglected actors in the history of a secret Cold War episode in the
   subcontinent. India evidenced a concerned, if not always productive
   response to political warfare operations conducted by foreign powers
   inside its borders. Disquiet over the damage that the dissemination of
   disinformation and, in particular, the publication of forged documents
   smearing national governments could do to its relationships with
   international partners, ensured that India was never a passive player in
   the propaganda Cold War.}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Disinformation campaigns on online social networks (OSNs) in recent
   years have underscored democracy's vulnerability to such operations and
   the importance of identifying such operations and dissecting their
   methods, intents, and source. This paper is another milestone in a line
   of research on political disinformation, propaganda, and extremism on
   OSNs. A total of 40,000 original Tweets (not re-Tweets or Replies)
   related to the U.S. 2020 presidential election are collected. The
   intent, focus, and political affiliation of these political Tweets are
   determined through multiple discussions and revisions. There are three
   political affiliations: rightist, leftist, and neutral. A total of 171
   different classes of intent or focus are defined for Tweets. A total of
   25\% of Tweets were left out while defining these classes of intent. The
   purpose is to assure that the defined classes would be able to cover the
   intent and focus of unseen Tweets (Tweets that were not used to
   determine and define these classes) and no new classes would be
   required. This paper provides these classes, their definition and size,
   and example Tweets from them. If any information is included in a Tweet,
   its factuality is verified through valid news sources and articles. If
   any opinion is included in a Tweet, it is determined that whether or not
   it is extreme, through multiple discussions and revisions. This paper
   provides analytics with regard to the political affiliation and intent
   of Tweets. The results show that disinformation and extreme opinions are
   more common among rightists Tweets than leftist Tweets. Additionally,
   Coronavirus pandemic is the topic of almost half of the Tweets, where
   25.43\% of Tweets express their unhappiness with how Republicans have
   handled this pandemic.}},

Abstract = {{It is widely believed that the impact of fake news, internet rumors,
   hoaxes, deceptive memes etc. are spilling into the physical world from
   the virtual world. In fact, social media has had a significant role in
   the origination and spread of such deceptive communication, as social
   media users often lack awareness of the intentional manipulation of
   online content and are easily tricked into believing unverifiable
   content. In an increasingly polarized world where social media and the
   internet have pushed people to live inside ``echo chambers{''} and
   ``filter bubbles,{''} people consciously and unconsciously are exposed
   only to content that reinforce their confirmation bias. In such a
   scenario, people only agree with content that aligns with their
   preexisting beliefs and disagree with or label as ``fake{''} content
   that is opposed to their worldview. This paper proposes to study the
   psychological differences that cause people to either agree or disagree
   with such prejudiced and ideologically oriented online disinformation.}},

Abstract = {{The early English-language promoters of Nostradamus (Orson Welles and
   Erika Cheetham) had strong Leftist-Marxist connections including ties to
   the Cambridge 5 spy ring. Nostradamus was the top search anomaly of Sept
   11, 2001. Interest was driven by a surge in emails and text messages via
   the internet. This behavior is discussed in relation to known cyber
   threats from 2001. Similar spikes in Nostradamus searches (Google
   Trends) emanated from Poland (April 2010), Ukraine (March 2014), and in
   Hungary (August 2015). Nostradamus mirrors proven Russian disinformation
   operations, such as those that today implicate 9/11 as being an ``inside
   job{''} by the US government, or that the CIA killed JFK, or that the
   CIA engineered the AIDS virus. Noting Nostradamus' use by both the
   Allies and the Axis powers as a psychological warfare tool in World War
   2, the case is made that it was the Russians carrying out an
   ``information attack{''} on 9/11 that is consistent with Russian cyber
   warfare and active measures strategy; and that they may have used
   similar techniques elsewhere since 2001.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR 12}},
Abstract = {{The coronavirus pandemic has seen a marked rise in medical
   disinformation across social media. A variety of claims have garnered
   considerable traction, including the assertion that COVID is a hoax or
   deliberately manufactured, that 5G frequency radiation causes
   coronavirus, and that the pandemic is a ruse by big pharmaceutical
   companies to profiteer off a vaccine. An estimated 30\% of some
   populations subscribe some form of COVID medico-scientific conspiracy
   narratives, with detrimental impacts for themselves and others.
   Consequently, exposing the lack of veracity of these claims is of
   considerable importance. Previous work has demonstrated that historical
   medical and scientific conspiracies are highly unlikely to be
   sustainable. In this article, an expanded model for a hypothetical en
   masse COVID conspiracy is derived. Analysis suggests that even under
   ideal circumstances for conspirators, commonly encountered
   conspiratorial claims are highly unlikely to endure, and would quickly
   be exposed. This work also explores the spectrum of medico-scientific
   acceptance, motivations behind propagation of falsehoods, and the urgent
   need for the medical and scientific community to anticipate and counter
   the emergence of falsehoods.}},

Title = {{Perceptions of Fake News, Misinformation, and Disinformation Amid the
   COVID-19 Pandemic: A Qualitative Exploration}},
Journal = {{PSYCHOLOGY OF POPULAR MEDIA}},
Abstract = {{Fake news and misinformation spread quickly and virulently during the
   height of the COVID-19 pandemic, potentially outpacing the spread of the
   virus itself across the globe. This study aimed to develop a greater
   understanding of how individuals make sense of and interact with
   information they suspect to be fake by exploring perceptions of
   information sharing on social media during the COVID-19 pandemic. A
   total of 24 participants (N-female = 14, N-male = 10) took part in
   semistructured telephone interviews from March to June 2020. Thematic
   analysis was guided by principles of social constructionism. A total of
   3 themes were developed from the data. First, participant interactions
   with information on social media were directed by the intention
   ``Staying Social.{''} Second, the role of social media and the
   uncertainty of the pandemic was framed as ``A Perfect Storm for Fake
   News.{''} Third, participants framed interactions in terms of
   ``Fact-Checking{''} with differing rigor in this process. The data
   demonstrated the complexities involved when it came to participants'
   experiences related to fake news and misinformation surrounding the
   COVID-19 pandemic. The results also highlight some of the key challenges
   faced when it comes to preventing the spread of fake news and
   misinformation, particularly from the online to the offline environment.
   The results are discussed in the context of strategies and frameworks
   that can aid in educating individuals about the dangers of
   misinformation.
   Public Policy Relevance Statement An understanding of individual
   interactions with misinformation on social media during a global crisis
   provides critical insight into reasons related to proliferation,
   understanding, and acceptance of fake news. This article presents a
   qualitative exploration of individual interactions with misinformation
   on social media during the early weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic. The
   results are presented alongside a discussion of potential approaches
   that could help prevent the further spread of misinformation in future
   crises.}},

Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Curated, labeled, high-quality data is a valuable commodity for tasks
   such as business analytics and machine learning. Open data is a common
   source of such data-for example, retail analytics draws on open
   demographic data, and weather forecast systems draw on open atmospheric
   and ocean data. Open data is released openly by governments to achieve
   various objectives, such as transparency, informing citizen engagement,
   or supporting private enterprise. Critical examination of ongoing social
   changes, including the post-truth phenomenon, suggests the quality,
   integrity, and authenticity of open data may be at risk. We introduce
   this risk through various lenses, describe some of the types of risk we
   expect using a threat model approach, identify approaches to mitigate
   each risk, and present real-world examples of cases where the risk has
   already caused harm. As an initial assessment of awareness of this
   disinformation risk, we compare our analysis to perspectives captured
   during open data stakeholder consultations in Canada.}},

Abstract = {{This second part of a two-part article moves ahead in showing how the
   East German Ministry for State Security (Stasi) came to play a key role
   in the disinformation campaign launched by the Soviet State Security
   Committee (KGB) in 1983 regarding the origins of the Human
   Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome
   (AIDS). The KGB launched the campaign itself, but in the mid-1980s it
   sought to widen the effort by enlisting the cooperation of intelligence
   services in other Warsaw Pact countries, especially the Stasi. From the
   autumn of 1986 until November 1989, the Stasi played a central role in
   the disinformation campaign. Despite pressure from the U.S. government
   and a general inclination of Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev to curtail
   the campaign by the end of 1987, both the KGB and the USSR's official
   Novosti press agency continued until 1989 to spread false allegations
   that HIV was a U.S. biological weapon. Even after the KGB curtailed its
   disinformation in 1989, the Stasi continued to disseminate falsehoods,
   not least because it had successfully maintained plausible deniability
   regarding its role in the campaign. The Stasi worked behind the scenes
   to support the work of Soviet-East German scientists Jakob Segal and
   Lilli Segal and to facilitate dissemination of the Segals' views in West
   Germany and Great Britain, especially through the leftwing media, and to
   purvey broader disinformation about HIV/AIDS by attacking U.S.
   biological and chemical weapons in general.}},

Abstract = {{The increased amounts of inaccurate, truncated or fabricated information
   flowing through different channels of communication indicate the need
   for understanding better the disinformation phenomenon, and how people
   are confronted with it. Considering that such understanding might
   indicate valuable paths towards mitigating disinformation impacts, the
   present paper presents the results of a qualitative study based on
   face-to-face in-depth interviews conducted in the end of 2018 with
   Romanian postgraduate students. The study portrays the disinformation
   phenomenon through interviewee's eyes. It delineates the main areas of
   concern, commonly shared opinions, adopted attitudes and self-protection
   behaviors. revealing a high level of awareness among Romanian youth with
   high education. The findings emphasize the importance of critical
   thinking. The study concludes that, apart from the tools provided by
   fact-checkers, technology companies and regulatory bodies, the increase
   of citizen's responsibility is needed to tackle disinformation and
   misinformation, because people's involvement is required to grow the
   level of critical thinking and media literacy at an individual and

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{10}},

Abstract = {{Individuals who encounter false information on social media may actively
   spread it further, by sharing or otherwise engaging with it. Much of the
   spread of disinformation can thus be attributed to human action. Four
   studies (totalN= 2,634) explored the effect of message attributes
   (authoritativeness of source, consensus indicators), viewer
   characteristics (digital literacy, personality, and demographic
   variables) and their interaction (consistency between message and
   recipient beliefs) on self-reported likelihood of spreading examples of
   disinformation. Participants also reported whether they had shared
   real-world disinformation in the past. Reported likelihood of sharing
   was not influenced by authoritativeness of the source of the material,
   nor indicators of how many other people had previously engaged with it.
   Participants' level of digital literacy had little effect on their
   responses. The people reporting the greatest likelihood of sharing
   disinformation were those who thought it likely to be true, or who had
   pre-existing attitudes consistent with it. They were likely to have
   previous familiarity with the materials. Across the four studies,
   personality (lower Agreeableness and Conscientiousness, higher
   Extraversion and Neuroticism) and demographic variables (male gender,
   lower age and lower education) were weakly and inconsistently associated
   with self-reported likelihood of sharing. These findings have
   implications for strategies more or less likely to work in countering
   disinformation in social media.}},

Abstract = {{In this policy brief, after an account of the historical-political
   context of Russia's recent aggressive actions, I examine the objectives,
   strategy, and tactics of Russia's information warfare, particularly as
   concerns eastern Europe and Syria, although also against selected
   western European states and the USA. Of special interest is the notion
   that Russia's disinformation is potent because it does not necessarily
   establish falsehoods as true, but rather pollutes political discourse
   such that news information consumers are led to doubt the very concepts
   of truth and objective political facts. I conclude by (a) discussing the
   impact this strategy has had-and will continue to have-on Europe's
   domestic politics, as well as on the global liberal order, and then (b)
   broaching policy ideas for countering Russian disinformation.}},

Abstract = {{Societies across the globe suffer from the effects of disinformation
   campaigns creating an urgent need for a way of tracking falsehoods
   before they become widely spread. Although building a detection tool for
   online disinformation campaigns is a challenging task, this paper
   attempts to approach this problem by examining content-based features
   related to language use, emotions, and engagement features through
   explainable machine learning. We propose a model that, except for the
   textual attributes, harnesses the predictive power of the users'
   interactions on the Facebook platform, and forecasts deceptive content
   in (i) news articles and in (ii) Facebook news-related posts. The
   findings of the study show that the proposed model is able to predict
   misleading news stories with a 98\% accuracy based on features such as
   capitals in the main body, headline length, Facebook likes, the total
   amount of nouns and numbers, lexical diversity, and arousal. In
   conclusion, the paper provides new insights concerning the false news
   identifiers crucial for both news publishers and consumers.}},

Abstract = {{Warfare is as old as the history itself. War armament has always been
   used, evolving from fighting axes, manufactured from sharp-edged stones,
   aiming at individual destruction to Weapons of Mass Destruction or
   weapon capable of inducing a certain collective or individual behaviour.
   Gradually, the savage battle transformed into state-level conflicts, and
   the short period of peace and anarchy gave a meaning to confrontations,
   along the stormy history of mankind.
   But deep in the core of warfare there is another battle, silent and
   often unknown to those involved in decision - making processes at
   military level. Regularly, these actions are not registered in historic
   chronicles. Due to the lack of documents to attest the war misleading
   actions or enemy deceit operations, the historians write about the front
   battles and ignore such actions, even when they seem to be obvious. Both
   in war and in peacetime, such actions are well hidden, without
   possibility of identification. Sometimes, after several years since the
   ending of a war, important documents are discovered, revealing secret
   origins of victory or failure.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we examine what `data literacy' - under various
   definitions - means at a time of persistent distribution of
   `dis-/mis-/mal-information' via digital media. The paper first explores
   the definition of literacies (written, media, information, digital and
   data literacies) considering the various parameters and considerations
   they have gone through. We then examine the intersection of
   dis-/mis-/mal-information and lake-news' and these literacies. The paper
   explores what types of literacies are needed today and the important
   role of variations in citizens' social context. We highlight three main
   gaps in current data literacy frameworks - 1. going beyond the
   individual; 2. critical thinking of the online ecosystem; and 3.
   designing skills for proactive citizens. We discuss these gaps while
   highlighting how we integrated these into our survey of UK citizens'
   data literacies as part of our Nuffield Foundation funded project - Me
   and My Big Data. By discussing our theoretical and methodological
   challenges we aim to shed light on not only how the definition of data
   literacy changes but also how we can develop education programmes that
   take into account information distortions and put proactive citizens at
   the centre.}},

Abstract = {{The authenticity of the information has become a topic of great social
   repercussion. In the digital environment, the scope and effects of the
   dissemination of distorted, inaccurate or false information acquire
   enormous potential due to the impact they have in the real world, in
   minutes, for millions of citizens. This research has investigated the
   following questions: Are university students capable of discerning the
   veracity of the information that reaches them? How and to what extent
   are information consumption habits related to the previous question? Do
   they know instruments such as fact-checkers to identify fake news, or do
   they build their own contrast strategies? The level of trust generated
   by the different sources of information, from local and regional media
   to large media, as well as social networks, has also been studied, with
   the aim of analyzing how the crisis of trust in the media it is
   translated into information consumption habits and how they position
   themselves in the complex media ecosystem. The work is based on the
   administration of a questionnaire to a representative sample (n=830) of
   students from the University of the Balearic Islands. The results of the
   study show, on the one hand, the deficits that university students
   present when it comes to recognizing false news, secondly, they show
   very little use of tools to contrast the veracity of the information
   and, finally, they allow outline the relationship between different
   types of information consumption and the ability to recognize fake news.}},

Abstract = {{Contacts between the Romanians and Turkic Nomads: Disinformation,
   Mystification and Xenophobia: N. Berend The article is a polemical
   response to a review published by Nora Berend to V Spinei's book
   Romanians and the Turkic Nomads North of the Danube Delta from the Tenth
   to the Mid-Thirteenth Century (2009), focusing on Nora Berend's lack of
   familiarity with the specific subject matter and on her poorly disguised
   bias against the Romanians. The author argues that the review in
   question was meant neither to present the book, nor to analyze its
   contents. Instead, Nora Berend's goal was to incriminate the author, and
   to proclaim guilt before any evidence was presented. Dismantling Nora
   Berend's statements and demonstrating the fallacious nature of her
   arguments, the author nevertheless admits that the translation of his
   book and some formulations in it can be found to be unfortunate.}},

Volume = {{13}},

Abstract = {{Media literacy of schoolchildren is a key political goal worldwide:
   institutions and citizens consider media literacy training to be
   essential - among other aspects - to combat falsehoods and generate
   healthy public opinion in democratic contexts. In Spain, various media
   literacy projects address this phenomenon one of which is `Que no te la
   cuelen' ('Don't be fooled', QNTLC). The project, which has been
   developed by the authors of this viewpoint, is implemented through
   theoretical-practical workshops aimed at public and private secondary
   pupils (academic years 2018-19, 2019-20 and 2020-21), based around
   training in fake news detection strategies and online fact-checking
   tools for students and teachers. This viewpoint describes and reflects
   on this initiative, conducted in 36 training sessions with
   schoolchildren aged 14-16 years attending schools in Madrid, Valencia
   and Barcelona. The workshops are based on van Dijk's media literacy
   model, with a special focus on the `informational skills' dimension. The
   amount of information available through all kinds of online platforms
   implies an extra effort in selecting, evaluating and sharing
   information, and the workshop focuses on this process through seven
   steps: suspect, read/listen/watch carefully, check the source, look for
   other reliable sources, check the data/location, be self-conscious of
   your bias and decide whether to share the information or not. The QNTLC
   sessions teach and train these skills combining gamification strategies
   - online quiz, verification challenges, `infoxication' dynamics in the
   class - as well as through a public deliberation among students.
   Participants' engagement and stakeholders' interest in the programme
   suggest that this kind of training is important or, at least, attract
   the attention of these collectives in the Spanish context.}},

Journal = {{REIDOCREA-REVISTA EECTRONICA DE INVESTIGACION Y DOCENCIA CREATIVA}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{10}},
Abstract = {{While it may be thought that disinformation and `fake news' are concepts
   related to contemporary mass media, they are, indeed, much older
   concerns that have always been part of our society, tracing a media
   craze path and noticeably blooming nowadays due to the power of the
   media. This is why it is essential to cultivate critical thinking when
   approaching journalistic discourses. In this contribution we will employ
   feminist close reading methods (Lukic and Sanchez, 2011) to examine
   examples of how newspapers and public opinion can influence and deform a
   story. We will take Margaret Atwood's Alias Grace (1996) as a case study
   in order to approach to what an extent its main character is influenced
   by conflictive opinions which finally determine the performance of her
   identity. Is being aware of public opinion enough to grant this
   character control over the self-construction of her image? The
   conclusions of this paper will include some considerations regarding the
   use of critical tools such as feminist close reading in the classroom.
   The case of Alias Grace exemplifies the negative effects of
   disinformation and ultimately illustrates the transformative potential
   of critical rewritings of official ``HIStories(2){''}.}},

Abstract = {{Identifying fake news has become an important issue. Increasing usage of
   social media has led to an increase in the number of people who can be
   influenced, thus the spread of fake news can potentially impact
   important events. Fake news has become a major societal issue and a
   technical challenge for social media companies to identify and has led
   many to extreme measures, such as WhatsApp deleting two million of its
   users every month to prevent the spread of fake news. The current
   problem of fake news is rooted in the historical problem of
   disinformation, which is false information intentionally, and usually
   clandestinely, disseminated to manipulate public opinion or obfuscate
   the truth. Our work addresses the problem of identifying fake news by
   (i) detecting and analyzing fake news features (ii) identifying the
   textual and sociocultural characteristics fake news features.}},

Abstract = {{This paper provides a critical review of Positive Psychology as a
   paradigm. From its origins in the late 1990s, Positive Psychology has
   acquired great popularity without any critical thinking. The
   dissemination of its un-innovative discourse in the mass media and
   specialized journals is an example of the popularity it has gained. This
   unquestioned acceptance of the discourse of Positive Psychology has
   taken place all over the world, including Spain and Latin America. After
   reviewing the general characteristics of Positive Psychology, the
   article discusses the shortcomings that this paradigm should overcome to
   be considered reliable and valid. Succinctly, the review concludes that
   the theoretical approach of Positive Psychology is not novel. The
   discourse that supports positive psychology as a new and original
   approach is in fact an exhibition of disinformation and ignorance of
   Philosophy, cultural Anthropology and the history of Psychology. In
   conclusion, the future of Positive Psychology requires overcoming the
   serious theoretical and practical problems that prevent it from being
   considered a new paradigm.}},

   Operating via a JA front organization-an Arabic-language news agency set

   intelligence services, the project involved inter alia the planting of
   fabricated articles in the Lebanese and Syrian press with the aim of

   provides insights into the Zionist leadership's thinking, internal

Journal = {{SOCIAL MEDIA + SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{4}},

Abstract = {{Twitter is increasingly being used within the sociopolitical domain as a
   channel through which to circulate information and opinions. Throughout
   the 2016 US Presidential primaries and general election campaign, a
   notable feature was the prolific Twitter use of Republican candidate and
   then nominee, Donald Trump. This use has continued since his election
   victory and inauguration as President. Trump's use of Twitter has drawn
   criticism due to his rhetoric in relation to various issues, including
   Hillary Clinton, the size of the crowd in attendance at his
   inauguration, the policies of the former Obama administration, and
   immigration and foreign policy. One of the most notable features of
   Trump's Twitter use has been his repeated ridicule of the mainstream
   media through pejorative labels such as ``fake news{''} and ``fake
   media.{''} These labels have been deployed in an attempt to deter the
   public from trusting media reports, many of which are critical of
   Trump's presidency, and to position himself as the only reliable source
   of truth. However, given the contestable nature of objective truth, it
   can be argued that Trump himself is a serial offender in the propagation
   of mis- and disinformation in the same vein that he accuses the media.
   This article adopts a corpus analysis of Trump's Twitter discourse to
   highlight his accusations of fake news and how he operates as a serial
   spreader of mis- and disinformation. Our data show that Trump uses these
   accusations to demonstrate allegiance and as a cover for his own
   spreading of mis- and disinformation that is framed as truth.}},

Abstract = {{This article examines counterdisinformation policies to investigate how
   European countries are shaping the meaning and boundaries of social
   platforms' accountability. We describe the cultural determinants of
   social platforms' accountability through a content analysis technique
   that considered principles, actors, and instruments, resulting in four
   models of social platform accountability: accountability set by law,
   codecided accountability, regulated self-regulation, and pure
   self-regulation. Our results suggest that most of the 11 countries in
   this study maintain specific positions on the role of digital media in
   society. At the same time, some patterns of convergence were evident:
   the weakening of State control in favor of freedom of information; the
   enhancement of transparency in social platforms' politics-related
   activities as a guiding principle to ensure public monitoring; and the
   standardization of a multistakeholder model of coregulation. The article
   also focuses on the technological dimension of social platform
   accountability, enabling us to recognize the degree to which different
   models rely on algorithms. It then problematizes the limitations and
   risks of social platforms' accountability.}},

Abstract = {{Disinformation campaigns continue to thrive online, despite social media
   companies' efforts at identifying and culling manipulation on their
   platforms. Framing these manipulation tactics as `coordinated
   inauthentic behavior,' major platforms have banned culprits and deleted
   the evidence of their actions from social activity streams, making
   independent assessment and auditing impossible. While researchers,
   journalists, and civil society groups use multiple methods for
   discovering and tracking disinformation, platforms began to publish
   highly curated data archives of disinformation in 2016. When platform
   companies reframe manipulation campaigns, however, they downplay the
   importance of their products in spreading disinformation. We propose to
   treat social media metadata as a boundary object that supports research
   across platforms and use metadata as an entry point for investigating
   manipulation campaigns.
   We illustrate how platform companies' responses to disinformation
   campaigns are at odds with the interests of researchers, civil society,
   policy-makers, and journalists, limiting the capacity to audit the role
   that platforms play in political discourse. To show how platforms' data
   archives of `coordinated inauthentic behavior' prevent researchers from
   examining the contexts of manipulation, we present two case studies of
   disinformation campaigns related to the Black Lives Matter Movement. We
   demonstrate how data craft - the exploitation of metrics, metadata, and
   recommendation engines - played a prominent role attracting audiences to
   these disinformation campaigns. Additionally, we offer some
   investigative techniques for researchers to employ data craft in their
   own research of the disinformation. We conclude by proposing new avenues
   for research for the field of Critical Internet Studies.}},

Abstract = {{How does the content of so-called ?fake news? differ across Western
   democracies? While previous research on online disinformation has
   focused on the individual level, the current study aims to shed light on
   cross-national differences. It compares online disinformation
   re-published by fact checkers from four Western democracies (the US, the
   UK, Germany, and Austria). The findings reveal significant differences
   between English-speaking and German-speaking countries. In the US and
   the UK, the largest shares of partisan disinformation are found, while
   in Germany and Austria sensationalist stories prevail. Moreover, in
   English-speaking countries, disinformation frequently attacks political
   actors, whereas in German-speaking countries, immigrants are most
   frequently targeted. Across all of the countries, topics of false
   stories strongly mirror national news agendas. Based on these results,
   the paper argues that online disinformation is not only a
   technology-driven phenomenon but also shaped by national information
   environments.}},

Abstract = {{The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the world in ways not seen since the

Abstract = {{In its first 30 years the world wide web has revolutionized the
   information environment. However, its impact has been negative as well
   as positive, through corporate misuse of personal data and due to its
   potential for enabling the spread of disinformation.
   As a large-scale collaborative platform funded through charitable
   donations, with a mission to provide universal free access to knowledge
   as a public good, Wikipedia is one of the most popular websites in the
   world. This paper explores the role of Wikipedia in the information
   ecosystem where it occupies a unique role as a bridge between informal
   discussion and scholarly publication. We explore how it relates to the
   broader Wikimedia ecosystem, through structured data on Wikidata for
   instance, and openly licensed media on Wikimedia Commons. We consider
   the potential benefits for universities in the areas of information
   literacy and research impact, and investigate the extent to which
   universities in the UK and their libraries are engaging strategically
   with Wikimedia, if at all.}},

Abstract = {{The public health crisis created by COVID-19 represents a challenge for
   journalists and the media. Specialised information in healthcare and
   science has turned into a need to deal with the current situation as
   well as the demand for information by society. In this context of
   increased uncertainty, the circulation of fake news on social networks
   and messaging applications has proliferated, producing what has been
   known as `infodemic'. This paper is focused on the fact-checking of
   journalistic content using a combined methodology: content analysis of
   information denied by the main Spanish fact-checking platforms (Maldita
   and Newtral) and an in-depth questionnaire to these stakeholders. The
   results confirm the quantitative and qualitative evolution of
   disinformation. Quantitatively, more fact-checking is performed during
   the state of alarm. Qualitatively, hoaxes increase in complexity as the
   pandemic evolves, in such a way that disinformation engineering takes
   place, and it is expected to continue until the development of a
   vaccine.}},

Abstract = {{Drawing upon the misinformation stories debunked by the three accredited
   fact-checking platforms in Spain, a content analysis of all the hoaxes
   (N = 292) bound to the Covid-19 pandemic is performed, over the first
   month of the state of alarm decreed by the Spanish Government (March
   14th, 2020 - April 13th, 2020). The study shows that the hoaxes about
   the coronavirus were disseminated mainly on social networks and, among
   them, especially in closed ones, such as the WhatsApp mobile messaging
   application. It also detects the most frequent formal and content
   peculiarities of misinformation. The results reveal that the pandemic,
   in addition to generating a large number of hoaxes on health and
   science, also led to the dissemination of many political fake news. The
   formats, sources and territories of origin of the hoaxes are also
   explored. Beyond the empirical results, this study makes theoretical
   contributions in the framework of the emerging studies on information
   disorders. Specifically, it provides a definition of hoax, as well as a
   typology in which four main types are identified: joke, exaggeration,
   decontextualization and deception. Based on these four types, a `hoax
   severity diagram' is proposed.}},

   misinformation can facilitate violent conflicts and, conversely, how the
   successful refutation of misinformation can contribute to peace. We
   illustrate the relevant cognitive principles by examining two case
   studies. The first, a retrospective case, involves the Iraq War of 2003
   and the ``War on Terror.{''} The second, a prospective case, points to
   likely future sources of conflict arising from climate change and its

Volume = {{94}},
Number = {{5}},

Abstract = {{This article explores the dynamics of digital (dis)information in the
   conflict between Russia and Ukraine. International Relations scholars
   have presented the online debate in terms of `information warfare'-that
   is, a number of strategic campaigns to win over local and global public
   opinion, largely orchestrated by the Kremlin and pro-western
   authorities. However, this way of describing the online debate reduces
   civil society to a mere target for manipulation. This article presents a
   different understanding of the debate. By examining the social media
   engagement generated by one of the conflict's most important events-the
   downing of the Malaysian Airlines Flight 17 (MH17) over Ukraine-we
   explore how competing claims about the cause of the plane crash are
   disseminated by the state, media and civil society. By analysing
   approximately 950,000 tweets, the article demonstrates how individual
   citizens are more than purveyors of government messages; they are the
   most active drivers of both disinformation and attempts to counter such
   information. These citizen curators actively shape competing narratives
   about why MH17 crashed and citizens, as a group, are four times more
   likely to be retweeted than any other type of user. Our findings
   challenge conceptualizations of a state-orchestrated information war
   over Ukraine, and point to the importance of citizen activity in the
   struggle over truths during international conflicts.}},

Abstract = {{During the coronavirus pandemic miles of fake news have circulated,
   being a major concern for the European Union. This research has two
   objectives: (i) to identify what topics are covered by Instagram posts
   by the European Union during the coronavirus pandemic; (ii) and to
   analyse communications and proposals related to fake news and
   misinformation made to the face the crisis. To achieve these objectives,
   Content Analysis was the methodology used to analyse the 176
   publications made from the beginning of the pandemic until April 30th of
   2020 by the Parliament, the Commission and the Council of the European
   Union on their Instagram accounts. An analysis matrix of seven dimension
   was designed to codify the news in the MAXQDA 2020 Analytics Pro
   software. The results show that most of the news are related to inform
   citizens about cooperative action and projects in the European Union,
   and messages of support and solidarity. On the other hand, posts related
   to fake news and disinformation barely make up 10\% of the total.
   However, they offer different resources and strategies for citizens to
   verify the information by their own, based on a fundamental
   recommendation: contrasting the news with official institutions.}},

Abstract = {{This article examines the diffusion of misinformation published by the
   digital newspaper El Confidencial in a politically polarized context,
   analysing its behaviour in the digital conversation. The selected news
   relates some words pronounced by the president of the Generalitat of
   Catalonia, Quim Torra, in one of his official speeches, as well as the
   answer given by the Institute created in honour of the civil rights
   activist Martin Luther King. The purpose of this research is to take the
   aforementioned news story as a reference to study the influence of the
   ideologically mediated virtual relationships when terminating exposure
   to certain information. The case study employs techniques of massive
   data analysis in social networks, captured and elaborated using the tool
   Twitter Capture and Analysis Toolset (DMI-TCAT) and applying the
   algorithm Louvain Multinivell. It is thus possible to know how incorrect
   information and subsequent corrections are spread unevenly throughout a
   highly politicized network, in which different groups of users are
   exposed to different information. 27,648 actors and 76,815 connections
   were analyzed. In addition, the article discusses the utility of the
   Social Network and the Big Data Analysis in the detection of propagation
   of fake news and its eventual mitigation.}},

Title = {{Mobilization, Mass Perceptions, and (Dis)information: ``New{''} and
   ``Old{''} Media Consumption Patterns and Protest}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL MEDIA + SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{When people join in moments of mass protest, what role do different
   media sources play in their mobilization? Do the same media sources
   align with positive views of mass mobilizations among the public in
   their aftermath? And, what is the relationship between media consumption
   patterns and believing disinformation about protest events? Addressing
   these questions helps us to better understand not only what brings
   crowds onto the streets, but also what shapes perceptions of, and
   disinformation about mass mobilization among the wider population.
   Employing original data from a nationally representative panel survey in
   Ukraine (Hale, Colton, Onuch, \& Kravets, 2014) conducted shortly after
   the 2013-2014 EuroMaidan mobilization, we examine patterns of media
   consumption among both participants and non-participants, as well as
   protest supporters and non-supporters. We also explore variation in
   media consumption among those who believe and reject disinformation
   about the EuroMaidan. We test hypotheses, prominent in current protest
   literature, related to the influence of ``new{''} (social media and
   online news) and ``old{''} media (television) on protest behavior and
   attitudes. Making use of the significance of 2014 Ukraine as a testing
   ground for Russian disinformation tactics, we also specifically test for
   consumption of Russian-owned television. Our findings indicate that
   frequent consumption of ``old{''} media, specifically Russian-owned
   television, is significantly associated with both mobilization in and
   positive perceptions of protest and is a better predictor of believing
   ``fake news{''} than consuming ``new{''} media sources.}},

Title = {{Knowledge, attitude and disinformation regarding vaccination and
   immunization practices among healthcare workers of a third-level
   paediatric hospital}},
Journal = {{ITALIAN JOURNAL OF PEDIATRICS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{45}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{AUG 19}},
Abstract = {{Background: Vaccination represents one of the most effective means of
   preventing infections for the population and for the public health in
   general. Recently there has been a decline in vaccinations, also among
   healthcare workers (HCWs). The aim of the study is to detect the
   knowledge, skills, attitudes and barriers of HCWs regarding vaccinations
   in a tertiary children's hospital in order to support clinical
   management in immunisation practices.
   Methods: An observational study was conducted on 255 subjects over a
   period of 8 months. The 31-item questionnaire considered profession,
   level of instruction and different ages. It included questions taken
   from a questionnaire used for a Canadian research and one used by the
   Bellinzona hospital. A 4-point Likert scale and closed-ended questions
   were used. A confidence interval of 95\%, p value = 0.05, Chi-square,
   ANOVA and the Kruskal-Wallis test were considered.
   Results: In the last 5 years less than one third of the sample were
   vaccinated against flu. 77.8\% (n. 130) of nurses and 45.8\% (n. 19) of
   doctors were not vaccinated (p < 0.0001). As for risk perception, 51.5\%
   of nurses and 90.6\% of doctors believe that their risk of contracting
   influenza is greater than that of the general population. In relation to
   the injection site, in all the age ranges there was a high level of
   knowledge except for those aged over 61 who responded incorrectly.
   Doctors were more prepared (p < 0.0001). 50\% of the sample used
   internet only as a source of information for vaccines. Generally,
   scientific sources were used infrequently. The higher the education
   level, the more frequent the utilisation of trustworthy scientific
   resources and literature. (p = 0.0002).
   Conclusions: In line with the attitude observed in recent years, nurses
   are not inclined to get vaccinated themselves although they agree to
   having their children vaccinated. HCWs have a good level of knowledge
   about vaccines and immunisation practices. With the nurses we found that
   the higher the education level, the greater the knowledge about vaccines
   which leads to the conclusion that low levels of adherence are not due
   to a lack of knowledge, but rather, to a low perception of risks. Hence
   the need to strengthen the vaccination strategies inside the companies.}},

   approach to understand this phenomenon. In this sense, a survey was
   conducted in a sample of four hundred participants, and, at the same
   time, the contents about COVID-19 that had been on Twitter were
   examined, as well as the ones found on various media and news in the
   region. The results of the analysis revealed that social networks
   influence the decision-making of governments; and, as they are often
   considered as sources of disinformation, they could act as instruments
   for manipulating the when with the Pandemic}},

Abstract = {{In this editorial, we seek to address the phenomenon of disinformation
   as something that endangers democratic regimes themselves. The ease of
   production and dissemination of information, provided mainly by access
   to the internet and technologies that use it, allows large volumes of
   information, both true and false, to circulate freely through networks.
   We approach the phenomenon of disinformation as opposed to parresia. We
   indicate the seriousness of disinformation not only because of the
   falsehood it carries, but also because of the difficulty of removing it
   over time. We highlight the problem of the subject using his Statute to
   pronounce performative statements in favor of disinformation. As a
   contribution that we bring some notes for the editors of scientific
   journals to combat the problems arising from infodemic, misinformation

Abstract = {{The global process of disseminating disinformation and the dispersion of
   fake content on digital platforms, instigated by the action of
   algorithms, contribute to the erosion of credibility of one core area of
   journalism: the professional cluster. The contemporary configuration of
   media ecology, which is intensified by disbelief towards the importance
   of expertise, results in the disqualification of journalists' cultural
   values and journalism a form of Knowledge. This article conducts a
   reflection on the erosion of the professional authority, supported by
   authors such as Abramson (2019), Kakutani (2018), Nichols (2017) and
   Schudson (2014; 2010). It also discusses, diversely, the notion of an
   expert system and the relationship between objectivity and big data as
   indicators of journalistic quality in a scenario in which most Internet
   users consume information that is perceived as reliable and credible.}},

   erasing the image of Fukushima as the location of one of the world's
   nuclear disasters, and, by so doing, reviving the prospects for the
   nation's nuclear industry. There remains a window in the coming months
   for a wider understanding of the complex reality in Fukushima, the
   ongoing radiological conditions and impacts, and the struggle of tens of

Abstract = {{The aim of this research is to study the misinformation processes that
   circulated during the presidential elections held in Argentina on
   October 27, 2019. These elections were presented as an interesting case
   study in which the candidates Mauricio Macri and Alberto Fernandez were
   fighting for the government in a economic crisis and with a divided
   society. The disinformation strategies were a fact, although in May
   press associations, digital platforms and political parties signed an
   agreement to combat false news on social media. In the research now
   presented, we analyze the role of Reverso -an initiative promoted and
   coordinated by Chequeado, AFP Factual, First Draft and Pop-Up Newsroom-.
   Within Reverso, more than 120 media and technology companies joined
   together to tackle misinformation during the electoral process. This
   research is based on obtaining and analysing the tweets published by
   Reverso on its Twitter account between 16 May and 29 October 2019. As
   results of the research, a typology of hoaxes and debunks that
   circulated as well as the identification of the preferential

Abstract = {{Political campaign advertising continues to be a controversial policy
   topic in advertising and marketing research. It is also a prime subject
   for investigating the ethical evaluations of consumers (or voters). The

   and subjective views about politics, candidates, and political
   advertising. The findings include emergent themes relating to
   significant media rituals in voters' lives, the cynical perspective of
   politics as a `game', and the widespread disapproval and suspicion with
   which voters regard negative political advertising. Additionally, the a
   priori theme of political information as `disinformation' was proposed
   and expanded upon. Findings are discussed in light of a greater
   understanding of the appropriateness of the traditional versus the
   postmodern perspective of political communication, informants'
   construction of `moral boundaries' which help them determine right from
   wrong, acceptable vs, unacceptable political behaviours in this

Journal = {{CRITICAL ARTS-SOUTH-NORTH CULTURAL AND MEDIA STUDIES}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{23}},

Pages = {{253-282}},
Abstract = {{Part II of `Contesting the mechanisms of disinformation' inspects
   prevalent Western imperialistic notions regarding revolutionary Cuba,
   and Fidel Castro's official contestation thereof: are Cubans denied
   basic rights that the `free world' takes for granted? Is Cuba ruled by a
   totalitarian, Stalinist regime? Have the Cuban people surrendered their
   basic liberties, even though they might have achieved their equality?
   How is the concept of democracy perceived and practised on the island?
   In terms of freedom of speech, what are the deeper meanings and
   implications of Castro's enduring cultural decree: within the
   revolution, everything, against the revolution, nothing? Since the
   capitalist system is based on a `philosophy of selfishness and brutal
   competition', is it able to resolve the problems of today's world? In
   this regard, the article brings `socialism' back into the equation,
   contending that it has remained fundamentally relevant in a world
   typified by exceeding levels of deprivation, conflict and partition.
   Revolutionary Cuba, in effect, has come to embrace a distinctly
   humanistic socialist belief system, portrayed, for example, in its
   unremitting concrete expression of internationalism and universal
   solidarity. As the supreme (prior) leader of the revolution, Castro
   himself is particularly recognised for his abhorrence of human
   prejudice, marginalisation and discrimination - an ethical framework
   that is manifested in Cuba's official position on race and racism. For
   obvious reasons, this distinguishing philosophy can be considered highly
   significant and appropriate to all spheres of South African society. In
   sum, the article sustains Fidel Castro's counter argument that the
   current global economic order - imposed by capitalism-imperialism
   through both calculated, predatory means and veiled mechanisms of
   disinformation - is not only `cruel, unfair, inhuman and contrary to the
   inevitable course of history, but also ``inherently racist{''}'.}},

Title = {{Social Bots and the Spread of Disinformation in Social Media: The
   Challenges of Artificial Intelligence}},
Journal = {{BRITISH JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT}},
Abstract = {{Artificial intelligence (AI) is creating a revolution in business and
   society at large, as well as challenges for organizations. AI-powered
   social bots can sense, think and act on social media platforms in ways
   similar to humans. The challenge is that social bots can perform many
   harmful actions, such as providing wrong information to people,
   escalating arguments, perpetrating scams and exploiting the stock
   market. As such, an understanding of different kinds of social bots and
   their authors' intentions is vital from the management perspective.
   Drawing from the actor-network theory (ANT), this study investigates
   human and non-human actors' roles in social media, particularly Twitter.
   We use text mining and machine learning techniques, and after applying
   different pre-processing techniques, we applied the bag of words model
   to a dataset of 30,000 English-language tweets. The present research is
   among the few studies to use a theory-based focus to look, through
   experimental research, at the role of social bots and the spread of
   disinformation in social media. Firms can use our tool for the early
   detection of harmful social bots before they can spread misinformation
   on social media about their organizations.}},

Abstract = {{The article is devoted to considering the difference between the
   concepts of ``misinformation{''} and ``disinformation{''}{''}. False
   information in the media is called disinformation or fake. However, not
   all false information is a result of a deliberate attempt to mislead the
   public. Along with disinformation there is misinformation that means the
   dissemination of false, erroneous information, the author of which is
   unaware of its falsehood. Unlike disinformation, a feature of
   misinformation is that the author does not intend to provide false
   information. The article attempts to distinguish between the concepts:
   ``disinformation{''}, ``misinformation{''} and the fake news relating to
   it. Technological and ethical mistakes are considered, which need to be
   avoided in order to prevent misinformation. The emergence of fakes in
   journalist articles is associated with a violation of the basic
   principles of journalism: truthfulness and objectivity, which are set
   out in the international documents on professional ethics representing
   the basic requirements for a journalist work with information. It is
   shown that the appearance of misinformation is associated with ignoring
   the basic principle of journalism: to describe life, and not a fictional
   reality. The approaches to verify facts are presented; and the
   techniques to recognize fake news in the media and social networks are
   discussed. (c) 2019 Published by Future Academy www.FutureAcademy.org.UK}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To explore the definitions and connections between the terms
   misinformation, disinformation, fake news, rumors, hoaxes, propaganda
   and related forms of misbehavior in the online environment. Another
   objective is to infer the intent of the authors, where relevant.
   Design/Methodology/Approach: A conceptual analysis of three hundred
   fifty articles or monographies from all types of disciplines with a
   priority of the articles focused on terminological analysis was being
   utilized. A conceptual map of the terminology that is relevant to the
   post-truth era was created. In the case of the lack of agreement, the
   etymology of the terms, utilizing dictionaries, terminological databases
   and encyclopedias, was favored.
   Results/Discussion: The approach made possible to delimit the borders
   between the core terms of post-truth society and to classify them
   according to the intents of the authors: power (influence), money, fun,
   sexual harassment, hate/discord, ignorance, passion and socialization.
   These features were identified to be able to differentiate the concepts:
   falsity (mislead-ingness, deceptiveness, lack of verification),
   accuracy, completeness, currency, medium, intent and analyzable unit.
   The conceptual map, summarizing and visualizing our findings is attached
   in the article.
   Conclusions: We argued that disinformation and misinformation are
   different terms with different authors and intents in the online
   environment. Likewise, fake news was delimitated as species of
   disinformation, which is limited by the medium and financial intent. The
   intent of hoaxers is rather the amusement of the authors or to spread
   discord between different groups of society. The intent and analyzable
   units as statement, claim, article, message, event, story and narrative
   that were identified in the literature, are crucial for the
   understanding and communication between social (human) scientists and
   computer scientists in order to better detect and mitigate various types
   of false information.
   Originality/Value: The study provides a theoretical background for
   detecting, analyzing and mitigating false information and misbehavior.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DATA SCIENCE AND ANALYTICS}},
Abstract = {{Modern neural language models can be used by malicious actors to
   automatically produce textual content looking as it has been written by
   genuine human users. Due to progress in the controllability of
   computer-generated text, there is a risk that state-sponsored actors may
   start using such methods for conducting large-scale information
   operations. Various detection algorithms have been suggested in the
   research literature to identify texts produced by language model-based
   generators, but these are often mainly evaluated on test data from the
   same distribution as they have been trained on. We evaluate promising
   Transformer-based detection algorithms in a large variety of experiments
   involving both in-distribution and out-of-distribution test data, as
   well as evaluation on more realistic in-the-wild data. It is shown that
   the generalizability of the detectors can be questioned, especially when
   applied to short social media posts. Moreover, the best performing
   (RoBERTa-based) detector is shown to be non-robust also to basic
   adversarial attacks, illustrating how easy it is for malicious actors to
   avoid detection by the current state-of-the-art detection algorithms.}},

Title = {{Online disinformation on Facebook: the spread of fake news during the
   Portuguese 2019 election}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY EUROPEAN STUDIES}},
Abstract = {{Elections worldwide have been marked by the spread of fake news. Online
   disinformation is everywhere, used as a political weapon in the
   battlefield of manipulation. This study focused on the Portuguese 2019
   elections to assess the reach of fake news compared to mainstream media
   news and to verify whether fake news had specific targets. We reviewed
   all posts (N=1197) from newspaper Facebook pages and fake news Facebook
   pages published during the campaign to verify their engagement. BuzzSumo
   assessed popularity by counting all posts' shares, reactions and
   comments. Iramuteq software related the content of all published
   headlines by analyzing clusters of the most frequent words. Findings
   show that fake news had no greater reach than real news during the
   election campaign. However, fake news are more likely to be shared,
   while real news tend to get more reactions and more comments. In fake
   news headlines the terms associated with left-wing and government are
   the most common. The prime minister and the Socialist Party are
   associated with negative connotations. Results suggest that Portuguese
   fake news are related to rightwing extremism and publish hate content
   targeting corruption and leftist policies in general. Unlike other
   countries, anti-immigration discourse and fearmongering were not
   prominent contents.}},

Abstract = {{There is global concern about the impact that `fake news' has on
   democratic decision-making processes. Democratic decision-making needs
   to be well informed and voters need a minimum of confidence in the
   information they receive about competitors. The Internet has increased
   the availability of information, but has allowed new ways of
   manipulating it to emerge. In recent electoral experiences, social media
   has increased the impact of misinformation on democracy. These
   experiences have shown us that Internet governance during the election
   campaign is an urgent issue. A laissez-faire approach to the electoral
   process is a threat to democracy because it allows all kinds of
   cheating. Institutions responsible for ensuring the integrity of
   elections need to try democratic resources to constrain competitors to
   behave responsibly. It is important to know the concrete experience of a
   country that has suffered the attack of disinformation campaigns during
   an election period, studying the action of the body responsible for
   organizing this process. This article discusses the guarantee of the
   electoral process based on the case study of the 2018 Brazilian

Abstract = {{This study is the first to scrutinize the psychological effects of
   online astroturfing in the context of Russia's digitally enabled foreign
   propaganda. Online astroturfing is a communicative strategy that uses
   websites, ``sock puppets,{''} or social bots to create the false
   impression that a particular opinion has widespread public support. We
   exposed N = 2353 subjects to pro-Russian astroturfing comments and
   tested: (1) their effects on political opinions and opinion certainty
   and (2) the efficiency of three inoculation strategies to prevent these
   effects. All effects were investigated across three issues and from a
   short- and long-term perspective. Results show that astroturfing
   comments can indeed alter recipients' opinions, and increase
   uncertainty, even when subjects are inoculated before exposure. We found
   exclusively short-term effects of only one inoculation strategy
   (refutational-same). As these findings imply, preemptive media literacy
   campaigns should deploy (1) continuous rather than one-time efforts and
   (2) issue specific rather than abstract inoculation messages.}},

   concept of disinformation and the Oxford Dictionaries the post-truth. In
   conclusion, the true attributes or conceptual characteristics guaranteed
   by the literature allowed us to affirm the circumstantiality of the
   cultural contexts in which these concepts are organized, as well as
   allowing us to present two structures of analysis: a discursive and

Abstract = {{Deepfakes are perceived as a powerful form of disinformation. Although
   many studies have focused on detecting deepfakes, few have measured
   their effects on political attitudes, and none have studied
   microtargeting techniques as an amplifier. We argue that microtargeting
   techniques can amplify the effects of deepfakes, by enabling malicious
   political actors to tailor deepfakes to susceptibilities of the
   receiver. In this study, we have constructed a political deepfake (video
   and audio), and study its effects on political attitudes in an online
   experiment (N= 278). We find that attitudes toward the depicted
   politician are significantly lower after seeing the deepfake, but the
   attitudes toward the politician's party remain similar to the control
   condition. When we zoom in on the microtargeted group, we see that both
   the attitudes toward the politician and the attitudes toward his party
   score significantly lower than the control condition, suggesting that
   microtargeting techniques can indeed amplify the effects of a deepfake,
   but for a much smaller subgroup than expected.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose The purpose of this study is to analyze citizen engagement and
   to explain the underlying mechanism that makes well-intended people to
   act as disinformation amplifiers in the online space. The study offers
   new insights to be used by knowledge management for improving society's
   potential to downsize the impact of disinformation that puts both
   knowledge system and social trust (ST) under high pressure.
   Design/methodology/approach The study proposes an integrative research
   model to explain how ST and conspiracy mentality (CM) are influencing
   citizen engagement in public life through different forms of action that
   is specific to offline or online spaces. The research model and its nine
   hypotheses are tested based on a survey for data collection and partial
   least squares method for data analysis.
   Findings The study finds that both online and offline actions are
   mediating the positive effect of ST on citizen engagement. Yet, CM has a
   high impact on online actions, and it exerts a significant indirect
   influence on citizen engagement in this manner.
   Originality/value Revealing the mediator role of online actions in the
   relationship between CM and civic engagement, the paper brings novel
   insights on disinformation spreading. The study explains how citizen
   engagement can sometimes be turned against social well-being because
   those prone to belief in conspiracies are the perfect targets of
   deceivers seeking for disinformation amplifiers in the online
   environment.}},

Abstract = {{This research aims to understand the persuasion techniques used in
   Twitter posts about COVID-19 vaccines by the different vaccine
   sentiments (i.e., Pro-Vaccine, Anti-Vaccine, and Neutral) using the
   Elaboration Likelihood Model, Social judgment Theory, and the Extended
   Parallel Process Model as theoretical frameworks. A content analysis was
   conducted on a data set of 1,000 Twitter posts. The corpus of Tweets was
   examined using the persuasion frameworks; tweets that were identified as
   emanating from bots were further examined. Results found Anti-Vaccine
   messages predominantly used Anecdotal stories, Humor/Sarcasm, and
   Celebrity figures as persuasion techniques, while Pro-Vaccine messages
   primarily used Information, Celebrity figures, and Participation.
   Results also showed the Anti-Vaccine messages primarily focused on
   values related to the categories of Safety, Political/Conspiracy
   Theories, and Choice. Finally, results revealed Anti-Vaccine messages
   primarily used Perceived Severity and Perceived Susceptibility, which
   are fear appeal elements. The findings for messages by bots were
   comparable to the messages in the larger corpus of tweets. Based on the
   findings, a response framework-Health Information Persuasion Exploration
   (HIPE)-is proposed to address mis/disinformation and Anti-Vaccine
   messaging. The results of this study and the HIPE framework can inform a
   national COVID-19 vaccine health campaign to increase vaccine adoption.}},

Abstract = {{The rise of ubiquitous deepfakes, misinformation, disinformation, and
   post-truth, often referred to as fake news, raises concerns over the
   role of the Internet and social media in modern democratic societies.
   Due to its rapid and widespread diffusion, digital deception has not
   only an individual or societal cost, but it can lead to significant
   economic losses or to risks to national security. Blockchain and other
   distributed ledger technologies (DLTs) guarantee the provenance and
   traceability of data by providing a transparent, immutable, and
   verifiable record of transactions while creating a peer-to-peer secure
   platform for storing and exchanging information. This overview aims to
   explore the potential of DLTs to combat digital deception, describing
   the most relevant applications and identifying their main open
   challenges. Moreover, some recommendations are enumerated to guide
   future researchers on issues that will have to be tackled to strengthen
   the resilience against cyber-threats on today's online media.}},

   study is multiple linear regression. Important findings of the study
   include the revelation of the disparity in the performance of the
   subjects from the underrepresented groups against those who are not.
   This paper further confirms that an increase in age is a risk for being
   Disinformed. The predictive model further reveals the profile of a most
   likely Disinformation victim. The intended target audiences of this
   paper are policymakers, social scientists, and tech companies.}},

Title = {{Detecting inorganic financial campaigns on Twitter}},
Journal = {{INFORMATION SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2022}},
Volume = {{103}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Online financial content is widespread on social media, especially on
   Twitter. The possibility to access open, real-time data about stock
   market information and firms' public reputation can bring competitive
   advantages to industry insiders. However, as many studies extensively
   demonstrated before, manipulative campaigns by social bots do not spare
   the financial sector either. In this work, we show that the more viral a
   stock is on Twitter, the more that virality is artificially caused by
   social bots. This result is also confirmed when considering accounts
   suspended by Twitter instead of bots. Starting from this finding, we
   then propose two methods for detecting the presence and the extent of
   financial disinformation on Twitter, via classification and regression.
   Our systems exploit hundreds of features to encode the characteristics
   of viral discussions, including features about: participating users,
   textual content of shared posts, temporal patterns of diffusion, and
   financial information about stocks. We experiment with different
   combinations of algorithms and features, achieving excellent results for
   the detection of financial disinformation (F 1 = 0.97) and promising
   results for the challenging task of estimating the extent of inorganic
   activity within financial discussions (R-2 = 0.81, MAE = 4.9\%). Our
   compelling results pave the way for the deployment of novel systems for
   protecting against financial disinformation. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Democratic nations around the globe are facing increasing levels of
   false and misleading information circulating on social media and news
   websites, propagating alternative sociopolitical realities. One of the
   most innovative actors in this process has been the Russian state, whose
   disinformation campaigns have influenced elections and shaped political
   discourse globally. A key element of these campaigns is the content
   produced by state-funded outlets like RT and Sputnik, whose articles are
   republished by underfunded or sympathetic local media, as well as
   coordinated groups that attempt to shape mainstream political
   narratives. Using a tailored text-as-data approach, we examine the
   thematic and linguistic differences in articles produced by U.S. and
   Russian state-funded and mainstream outlets in Serbia. We use 11
   features (frames and in-text characteristics) to construct an article
   country-source classifier with a high degree of accuracy. The article
   contributes toward an understanding of the structural characteristics of
   Russian state-funded news in the Western Balkans, enhances the
   application of computational text analysis in Serbian, and provides
   suggestions for the application of text-as-data methods to the study of
   online disinformation.}},

Abstract = {{Principles of molecular biology, (multi-factorial) genetics, genomics,
   pharmacogenomics and toxicogenomics govern computational biology and
   disinformation, in general. There is ample room for biostochastics to
   comprehend the basic difference between mathematical determinacy
   (prevailing in physical and engineering sciences) and biological
   diversity as commonly perceived in this emerging interdisciplinary field
   of research. Various disciplines, including biology, computational
   mathematics, computer science, physics and statistics, are looking
   through the edges of this prism in their own way. With the evolution of
   information technology, computational facilities are expanding in an
   astounding way, and thus providing access to massive data sets arising
   in disinformation and genomics. Knowledge discovery and data mining
   tools are increasingly advocated for quantitative assessments, albeit
   often without adequate statistical validation and interpretation. High
   dimensionality relative to low sample size restraints create impasses
   for adoption of conventional statistical methodology in genomic studies
   and require highly nonstandard statistical appraisals. Biostochatitic
   undercurrents deserve a critical assessment in such complex studies.
   Beyond parametrics perspectives are highlighted in this appraisal.}},

Abstract = {{Using a survey of U.S. adults, this research examines the content,
   source, and typology cues that people rely on when assessing
   misinformation in the news, frequently referred to as fake news, and how
   those factors impact the confidence they have in their ability to
   identify fake news. Participants' confidence in recognizing fake news
   was significantly affected by their patterns of looking at news cues,
   such as a story's URL and author, as well as by their engaging in their
   own research and seeking out news that confirms what they already
   believe. These findings signal a need for increased, continuous news
   literacy education designed to empower the public to push back against
   the seedy allure of fake news and other forms of misinformation that
   pose as legitimate, objective news.}},

Year = {{2020}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Policymakers, scholars, and practitioners have all called attention to
   the issue of misinformation in the climate change debate. But what is
   climate change misinformation, who is involved, how does it spread, why
   does it matter, and what can be done about it? Climate change
   misinformation is closely linked to climate change skepticism, denial,
   and contrarianism. A network of actors are involved in financing,
   producing, and amplifying misinformation. Once in the public domain,
   characteristics of online social networks, such as homophily,
   polarization, and echo chambers-characteristics also found in climate
   change debate-provide fertile ground for misinformation to spread.
   Underlying belief systems and social norms, as well as psychological
   heuristics such as confirmation bias, are further factors which
   contribute to the spread of misinformation. A variety of ways to
   understand and address misinformation, from a diversity of disciplines,
   are discussed. These include educational, technological, regulatory, and
   psychological-based approaches. No single approach addresses all
   concerns about misinformation, and all have limitations, necessitating
   an interdisciplinary approach to tackle this multifaceted issue. Key
   research gaps include understanding the diffusion of climate change
   misinformation on social media, and examining whether misinformation
   extends to climate alarmism, as well as climate denial. This article
   explores the concepts of misinformation and disinformation and defines
   disinformation to be a subset of misinformation. A diversity of
   disciplinary and interdisciplinary literature is reviewed to fully
   interrogate the concept of misinformation-and within this,
   disinformation-particularly as it pertains to climate change. This
   article is categorized under: Perceptions, Behavior, and Communication
   of Climate Change > Communication}},

Abstract = {{As people rely on social media as their primary sources of news, the
   spread of misinformation has become a significant concern. In this
   large-scale study of news in social media, we analyze 11 million posts
   and investigate the propagation behavior of users that directly interact
   with news accounts identified as spreading trusted versus malicious
   content. Unlike previous work, which looks at specific rumors, topics,
   or events, we consider all content propagated by various news sources.
   Moreover, we analyze and contrast population versus subpopulation
   behavior (by demographics) when spreading misinformation, and
   distinguish between the two types of propagation, i.e., direct retweets
   and mentions. Our evaluation examines how evenly, how many, how quickly,
   and which users propagate content from various types of news sources on
   Twitter. Our analysis has identified several key differences in
   propagation behavior from trusted versus suspicious news sources. These
   include high inequity in the diffusion rate based on the source of
   disinformation, with a small group of highly active users responsible
   for the majority of disinformation spread overall and within each
   demographic. Analysis by demographics showed that users with lower
   annual income and education share more from disinformation sources
   compared to their counterparts. News content is shared significantly
   more quickly from trusted, conspiracy, and disinformation sources
   compared to clickbait and propaganda. Older users propagate news from
   trusted sources more quickly than younger users, but they share from
   suspicious sources after longer delays. Finally, users who interact with
   clickbait and conspiracy sources are likely to share from propaganda
   accounts, but not the other way around.}},

Abstract = {{Social media is becoming more and more of a security threat.
   Dissatisfaction with the content and quality of the information flow is
   increasing not only at the nation-state level, but also at the level of
   people's everyday lives. Social media is one of the key channels for
   distributing disinformation and it has become a key instrument for
   influencing political activity in particular. It is difficult to single
   out individual contributors or culprits when it comes to the
   dissemination of disinformation due to the rhizomatic nature of the
   internet and the Western approach to using social media. The same
   principles such as ease of access to the network, democracy, freedom of
   speech, and knowledge equality have also made it easier to distribute
   disinformation. Presidents Trump and Putin have created a new global
   power order by using information for their own political purposes. At
   the same time, small countries like Finland have become increasingly
   dependent on the global information flow, and are likewise increasingly
   subjected to the proliferation of disinformation. Hence, social media
   has become an ever-more crucial factor in terms of national security as
   well as citizens' daily lives. This study focuses on social media as a
   platform for disinformation distribution, and aims to mirror the
   theoretical evolution of social media in the Finnish discussion about
   national security. The empirical data will be collected by surveying
   young Finns who will take part in compulsory military service. In this
   paper, we create the framework for the research project, which explores
   young people's agency in social media. We specifically address issues
   related to information influence, propaganda, and disinformation. Our
   perspective is on society's comprehensive security and we seek to
   investigate the way in which social media influences young people's
   safety and security situation picture. In addition, we explore whether
   the discussion in social media influences attitudes towards both
   personal safety and national security. The study is part of a broader
   Academy of Finland research project entitled ``Media and Society{''}.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: This study focuses on the analysis of the perception on
   the roles of mass media during the health crisis derived from the
   COVID-19 pandemic. It also studies how people adopt specific roles
   oriented towards the legitimation and implementation of control and
   social norms. Methodology: A questionnaire was designed based on a set
   of Likert type answers responded by 704 people from different regions in
   Spain. Data were analyzed using SPSS software package. Results: Results
   indicate that sex and age are determining variables in the legitimation
   and implementation of social control between peers. Results also
   indicate that there is a relationship between the way people perceive
   the role of media and their predisposition to abide by and exercise
   social norms and control. Discussion and conclusions: Both the
   literature and obtained data show that there is a relationship between
   the role of media in situations of social alarm and health crisis, and
   the processes of construction and legitimation of cosmovisions of
   ``reality{''} derived from disinformation, hoaxes and noise information.}},

Abstract = {{Disinformation campaigns such as fake news have evolved beyond
   traditional propaganda and are being used in strategic ways. Further,
   sources of information have changed from traditional media (newspapers,
   fliers, radio) to multi social media platforms (Twitter, You-Tube,
   Reddit). This paper addresses how cognitive psychology research related
   to traditional texts and news discourse applies to information garnered
   in the changing social media environment and especially false
   information. Specifically, the memory representations that readers
   create when they read text and how they are able to integrate complex
   ideas from multiple sources (including images) are reviewed. An emphasis
   is placed on the fragility of memory representations such as the
   susceptibility to information reconstruction and how that vulnerability
   can interact with disinformation. Potential ways to counter
   disinformation are explored such as perspective shifting, changing the
   context, and thinking analytically. In addition, this paper will
   identifies what gaps need to be addressed in the growing research areas
   of misinformation and fake news.}},

Abstract = {{This article explores the transformative role of practices of countering
   digital disinformation in European Union diplomacy. It argues that an
   overlooked dimension of the change brought by the rise of digital
   disinformation is located in the emergence of everyday countering
   practices. Efforts to counter disinformation have led to the recruitment
   of new actors with different dispositions and skill sets than those of
   traditional diplomats and state officials in diplomatic organizations
   such as the European External Action Service. Focusing on the countering
   efforts by the East StratCom Task Force, a unit introduced in 2015, the
   article argues that the composition of actors, the task force's
   practices and the reorientation in audience perception it reflected,
   contributed significantly to institutional transformation. Drawing on 23
   interviews with key actors and building on recent advancements in
   international practice theory, the article shows how change and
   transformation can be studied in practices that have resulted from
   digitalization in international politics. The article thus contributes
   to an increased understanding of the digitalization of diplomacy in
   which new practices can emerge from both deliberate reflection and
   experimentation.}},

   Vividness in Understanding the Power of AI-Enabled Deepfake News}},
Journal = {{MEDIA PSYCHOLOGY}},
Abstract = {{While deepfake has emerged as a severe issue in the multimedia
   environment, most studies examined text-based false claims, leaving the
   question of what unique features of video-based deepfake news deceives
   recipients and how it can be corrected. By conducting two online
   experiments, we study perceived source vividness as a psychological
   mechanism of the effect of AI-enabled deepfake news on news credibility
   and engagement intentions. Furthermore, we test how an inserted
   false-tag onto the fake news can reduce the impact of source vividness
   experienced by seeing multimodal disinformation on news credibility and
   engagement intentions. The results suggest that participants who saw
   deepfake news had higher source vividness than those who saw fake news
   with other modalities (i.e., text-only and text-photo), and such source
   vividness increased credibility and engagement intentions of fake news.
   The false-tag successfully reduced engagement intentions of deepfake
   news for those who perceived a high vividness of the superimposed
   interviewee.}},

Title = {{Diabolical Suggestions: Disinformation and the Curious Scale of
   Nationalism in Ukrainian Geopolitical Fault-line Cities}},
Journal = {{GEOPOLITICS}},
Abstract = {{During the past few years, research on conflict in cities has built
   valuable intellectual bridges across boundaries into numerous
   surrounding fields. One such area - the study of the spatiality of
   (dis/mis-)information - is an indispensable ingredient in the concept of
   the geopolitical fault-line city, the empirical solidity of which this
   article sets out to investigate using the case of two strategically
   crucial cities in Ukraine: Kharkiv and Dnipro. Two main questions are
   addressed: (1) Who places the blame for the Russo-Ukrainian war
   primarily on Russia? (2) Who would be ready to oppose a hypothetical
   Russian invasion of the city using non-violent methods? Because Russia
   is the party primarily responsible for the unfolding of armed conflict
   in Ukraine, the first question implicitly explores who it is that is
   least influenced by pro-Russian disinformation narratives, whereas the
   second question explores the central security implication of this
   particular situation. The article uses data from two sample surveys
   conducted in the case study cities in 2018 (n = ca. 1250 for each city),
   and reports its findings in amultivariate setting, aiming to contribute
   to the general literature on divided and contested cities, as well as to
   the more specific literature on the Russo-Ukrainian conflict. The
   results show that the categories of ``Ukrainian{''} and ``Russian{''}
   are of relatively little salience in the case study cities, contrary to
   the (now slowly fading) narrative of ethnic polarization that has been
   haunting many academic and especially media portrayals of Ukraine. What
   matters, instead, is self-identification as ``European{''} or
   ``Soviet{''}, imaginary supranational communities that are geopolitical
   at heart.}},

Abstract = {{Misinformation and disinformation regarding COVID-19 and vaccination
   against it may be contributing to vaccine hesitancy. Social media
   outlets have reportedly made efforts to limit false information yet
   untruths related to COVID-19 persist online. The purpose of this study
   was to describe the content on COVID-19 vaccination on TikTok, an
   emerging social media platform. One-hundred trending videos were
   identified from the hashtag \#covidvaccine and were coded for content.
   Collectively, these videos garnered over 35 million views. The coding
   category with the highest number of videos was ``Discouraged a
   Vaccine{''} (n = 38), followed by ``Encouraged a Vaccine{''} (n = 36).
   While only 36 videos encouraged a vaccine, these videos garnered over
   50\% of the total cumulative views and just under 50\% of the total
   likes; the 38 videos that discouraged a vaccine garnered 39.6\% of the
   total cumulative views, 44.3\% of likes, and 47.4\% of comments. Of the
   38 videos discouraging the vaccine, 25 (65.79\%) showed a parody of an
   adverse reaction and, collectively, received 71.07\% of the total views
   among videos in this category. Twenty-two of these 38 videos (57.89\%)
   falsely conveyed that a vaccine was available, as they were not at the
   time of the study. Anti-vaccination messaging may undermine efforts to
   ensure widespread uptake of the various COVID-19 vaccines, particularly
   for young people who are more likely than other age cohorts to use
   TikTok.}},

Abstract = {{Megaprojects contribute increasingly to urban development policies.
   These are projects associated with transport or infrastructure
   development that involve major transformations and changes in space.
   Power relations, divergent interests, inequalities in the distribution
   of the costs and benefits involved, as well as actors' different
   capacities become apparent. Megaprojects tend to be non-transparent as
   promoters (usually the public sector) face with opacity the risk of
   major opposition. On the other hand, transformation of the urban policy
   agenda advances towards more horizontal arrangements, collaborative
   processes and consideration of environmental impacts. Consequently,
   citizen involvement in policy decision-making increasingly appears to be
   a resource for urban governance. The execution of the line 12 project of
   the Mexico City's Underground Transport System is a good case to test
   the main thesis of both theoretical developments: megaprojects and
   citizen involvement as a mean to achieve more effective, equal and
   legitimate policies. This article examines both the mechanisms activated
   by the local government in order to consult the population and the
   strategies deployed by some sectors that were particularly affected by
   the project. It is proved that disinformation and the lack of
   communication prevailed and minimum mechanisms to engage citizens were
   activated. Once conflicts became visible, the local government chose
   dialogue tables with opponents and less visible negotiation processes
   that do not correspond to the type of mechanisms that favor open and
   democratic processes of citizen engagement in policy decision making.}},

Title = {{Establishing a taxonomy of potential hazards associated with
   communicating medical science in the age of disinformation}},
Journal = {{BMJ OPEN}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{7}},
Abstract = {{Objectives Disinformation on medical matters has become an increasing
   public health concern. Public engagement by scientists, clinicians and
   patient advocates can contribute towards public understanding of
   medicine. However, depth of feeling on many issues (notably vaccination
   and cancer) can lead to adverse reactions for those communicating
   medical science, including vexatious interactions and targeted
   campaigns. Our objective in this work is to establish a taxonomy of
   common negative experiences encountered by those communicating medical
   science, and suggest guidelines so that they may be circumvented. Design
   We establish a taxonomy of the common negative experiences reported by
   those communicating medical science, informed by surveying medical
   science communicators with public platforms. Participants 142 prominent
   medical science communicators (defined as having >1000 Twitter followers
   and experience communicating medical science on social and traditional
   media platforms) were invited to take part in a survey, with 101
   responses. Results 101 responses were analysed. Most participants
   experienced abusive behaviour (91.9\%), including persistent harassment
   (69.3\%) and physical violence and intimidation (5.9\%). A substantial
   number (38.6\%) received vexatious complaints to their employers,
   professional bodies or legal intimidation. The majority (62.4\%)
   reported negative mental health sequelae due to public outreach,
   including depression, anxiety and stress. A significant minority
   (19.8\%) were obligated to seek police advice or legal counsel due to
   actions associated with their outreach work. While the majority targeted
   with vexatious complaints felt supported by their employer/professional
   body, 32.4\% reported neutral, poor or non-existent support. Conclusions
   Those engaging in public outreach of medical science are vulnerable to
   negative repercussions, and we suggest guidelines for professional
   bodies and organisations to remedy some of these impacts on front-line
   members.}},

Title = {{Reactions to China-linked Fake News: Experimental Evidence from Taiwan}},
Journal = {{CHINA QUARTERLY}},
Abstract = {{China is accused of conducting disinformation campaigns on Taiwan's
   social media. Existing studies on foreign interventions in democratic
   societies predict that such disinformation campaigns should lead to
   increasing partisan polarization within Taiwan. We argue that a backlash
   effect, making Taiwan's citizens more united against China, is equally
   plausible. We conduct a survey experiment exposing participants to a
   real-life rumour and rebuttal to test these competing hypotheses. We
   find, at best, mixed evidence for polarization. Although neither rumour
   nor rebuttal mention China, there is consistent evidence of backlash
   against China. Most notably, participants across the political spectrum
   are more inclined to support Taiwanese independence after viewing the
   rumour rebuttal. These findings indicate that citizens may put aside
   partisanship when confronted with false news that is plausibly linked to
   an external actor. We conclude by discussing the broader applicability
   of our theory and implications for cross-Strait relations.}},

Abstract = {{How can a state react to being a target of disinformation activities by
   another state without losing the moral ground that it seeks to protect?
   This essay argues that the concept of moral authority offers an original
   framework for addressing this dilemma. As a power resource, moral
   authority enables an actor to have its arguments treated with priority
   by others and to build support for its actions, but only as long as its
   behavior does not deviate from certain moral expectations. To develop
   moral authority, an actor engaged in combating digital propaganda must
   cultivate six normative attributes: truthfulness and prudence for
   demonstrating the nature of the harmful effects of disinformation;
   accountability, integrity, and effectiveness for establishing the
   normative standing of the actor to engage in counter-intervention; and
   responsibility for confirming the proportionality of the response.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, concerns about the perceived increase in the amount of
   ``fake news{''} have become prevalent in discussions about media and
   politics, particularly in the United States and Europe. However, debates
   around ``fake news{''}, even if some object to the use of the term due
   to it being loosely defined, appear to speak of processes that occur not
   only in the Global North but also elsewhere. In Africa, mis- and
   disinformation campaigns have been used to influence political agendas,
   and governments have responded with countermeasures. This article
   explores the phenomenon in Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa using data
   from a two-wave online survey (N = 1847). We find that perceived
   exposure to disinformation is high, and that trust in social and
   national media is low. We also identify a significant relationship
   between higher levels of perceived exposure to disinformation and lower
   levels of media trust in South Africa. The limitations of this study,
   which focuses on a subset of the population that is highly educated, the
   implications of our findings, and recommendations for future research

Abstract = {{In the context of spiralling decay that, in recent decades, has engulfed
   all spheres of the human condition, this article seeks to endorse
   Tomaselli's essentially ethical position, advancing that the foremost
   contextual launching pad for cultural studies should be based on a
   socio-political moral framework that embraces concepts of truth,
   fairness, and freedom. It is argued that the rigorous questioning of -
   and hence, confrontation with dominant beliefs, perceptions, norms,
   standards, and rules embedded in a neo-liberal, corporate-aligned
   `democratic' global order will, by its very nature, contribute to the
   demise of human misfortune and injustice. As a viable start, cultural
   studies should return to the basically moral project of inquiry into
   injustice, oppression, and deception, and concretely undertake to have
   global influence in a world that has fewer and fewer margins separating
   truth from myth. The so-called `industry of deception' has stringently
   endeavoured, and continues to endeavour, to thwart the political
   awakening of Latin America's erstwhile dormant masses. As mandatory foot
   soldiers in imperialism's battle against this process of mass
   radicalisation, the dominant media have sought to preside over the
   voiceless by putting lies across as truths. In this manner the global
   media industry seeks to sustain imperialism's hegemony over not only the
   Latin American continent with its 500 million struggling subjects, but
   the great majority of the world's wretched masses. Contemporary
   developments in a range of Latin American countries - Argentina,
   Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Nicaragua, Paraguay, Venezuela, and others -
   show quite demonstratively the emergence of a new, radical political
   ethos amongst the continent's ordinary, struggling subjects, evoking
   both a measure of optimism amongst oppressed subjects elsewhere and
   overpowering responses from reactionary agents. By looking at the Latin
   American continent critically and truthfully, and more so, by contesting
   the `mechanisms of disinformation', scholars of culture hopefully could
   reclaim their authentic purpose in the intellectual sphere and
   meaningfully contribute to the invention of another world.}},

Title = {{The massive spreads and fatalities of COVID-19 pandemic in the USA:
   symptoms of leadership failure}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PUBLIC LEADERSHIP}},
Abstract = {{Purpose The purpose of this paper is to empirically examine whether the
   massive spreads and fatalities of the COVID-19 pandemic in the USA, the
   country with the most advanced medical technology in the world, are
   symptomatic of leadership failure. The authors posit that when political
   leaders, such as the President of the USA, in conjunction with a group
   of state governors and city mayors, employed conspiracy theories and
   disinformation to achieve their political goals, they contributed to the
   massive spreads and fatalities of the virus, and they also undermined
   the credibility of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
   and the health-care professionals in providing the pertinent control
   guidelines and true scientific-based medical information.
   Design/methodology/approach The authors conducted a review of current
   studies that address the handling of global infectious diseases to build
   a better understanding of the issue of pandemics. They then employed a
   theoretical framework to link the massive spreads and fatalities of the
   COVID-19 pandemic to political leaders, such as President Trump and the
   group of obsequious state governors and city mayors, who propagated
   conspiracy theories and disinformation through social media platforms to
   downplay the severity of the virus. The authors compared the massive
   spreads and fatalities of the COVID-19 pandemic in the USA under
   President Trump to President Obama who handled H1N1, Ebola, Zika and
   Dengue. More importantly, the authors compared President Trump's
   handling of the COVID-19 pandemic to other political leaders in advanced
   countries where there were no concerted efforts to spread conspiracy
   theories and disinformation about the health risks of COVID-19 pandemic.
   Findings The authors' theoretical analysis alluded to the fact that
   political leaders, such as President Trump, who are engulfed in
   self-deceptions, self-projections and self-aggrandizements would engage
   in self-promotion and avoid accountability for their missteps in
   handling global pandemic shocks. In contrast, political leaders in other
   advanced countries did not downplay the severity thus their ability to
   curtail the spreads and fatalities of the COVID-19 pandemic. Research
   limitations/implications The theoretical viewpoints presented in this
   paper along with the derivations of the spreads-fatalities curtailment
   coefficients and the spread-fatality upsurge coefficients under
   Presidents Obama and Trump, respectively, may not be replicable. Given
   this plausible limitation, future research may need to provide a deep
   analysis of the amplifications of conspiracy theories and disinformation
   because they are now deeply rooted in the political economy of the USA.
   Furthermore, since scientists and medical professionals may not be able
   to forecast future epidemics or pandemics with pin-point accuracy nor
   predict how political leaders would disseminate health risks information
   associated with different pathogens, it is imperative that future
   research addresses the positive or adverse effects of conspiracy
   theories and disinformation that are now easily propagated
   simultaneously through different social media platforms, which are
   currently protected under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act.
   The multiplier effects of conspiracy theories and disinformation will
   continue to amplify the division about the authenticity of COVID-19
   pandemic and the emergence or reemergence of other pathogens in the
   foreseeable future.
   Originality/value The authors derived the unique spreads-fatalities
   curtailment coefficients to demonstrate how President Obama used
   effective collaboration and coordination at all levels of government in
   conjunction with medical experts to curtail the spreads and fatalities
   associated with H1N1, Ebola, Zika and Dengue. They further derived the
   spreads-fatalities upsurge coefficients to highlight how President Trump
   contributed to the spreads and fatalities of COVID-19 pandemic through
   his inability to collaborate and coordinate with state governors, city
   mayors and different health-care agencies at the national and
   international levels.}},

   Using a mixed method model, we developed a focus group activity with a
   total of 45 participants, based on the analysis of 562 questionnaires
   previously administered to first-year undergraduates of two Portuguese
   universities. The results show that although most students report
   limited critical analysis of information, they do reveal concerns about
   disinformation in their lives, suggesting a set of actions in order to
   combat fake news spread. Furthermore, the findings reinforce the need
   for news and media literacy that concerns a post-fact culture.}},

   This article offers an analysis of articles on sex education published

   extreme and manipulated representations of sex education on these

   social anxiety by triggering emotions and utilising regionally sensitive
   issues to foment feelings of inferiority in post-socialist countries.
   The Russian Federation strives to be perceived as a saviour of
   traditional values, actively feeding a conservative backlash and
   anti-gender and anti-LGBT movements. It therefore recruits conservative
   allies across Europe to expand its sphere of influence.}},

Abstract = {{The chapter is dedicated to the conceptual analysis of disinformation
   2.0 as referring to machine-driven, technology-powered disinformation,
   qualitatively different from traditional, people-driven, disinformation
   carried out through conventional media. We argue in favor of the idea
   that what are witnessing right now is a proliferation technology-powered
   disinformation, a completely new phenomenon for which intellectual,
   regulatory and research tools barely exist. We discriminate between
   complex technological, socio-economic and psychological factors involved
   in this proliferation and the emergence of a completely new information
   ecosystem. We argue that, as a result of the phenomenal success of their
   digital platform technologies, the big technological companies act as
   global despots of our times, whose alleged dominance is enabled by their
   accelerated pace of innovation, their disruptive potential in the
   technological field, as well as by the actual fault lines and rising

Abstract = {{This article examines the political consequences of pre-Election Day
   poll restrictions. Our argument is that laws forbidding the publication
   of polling results hamper voters' electoral coordination when the
   information environment is more complex. We rely on aggregated data from
   elections in 46 democracies to show that the number of wasted votes
   increases in countries with highly fragmented party systems when
   pre-Election Day polls are restricted. This evidence is supported with
   individual data from Internet surveys conducted by the Making Electoral
   Democracy Work project during election campaigns in Canada and Spain.}},

Title = {{Identifying Twitter users who repost unreliable news sources with
   linguistic information}},
Journal = {{PEERJ COMPUTER SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Month = {{DEC 14}},
Abstract = {{Social media has become a popular source for online news consumption
   with millions of users worldwide. However, it has become a primary
   platform for spreading disinformation with severe societal implications.
   Automatically identifying social media users that are likely to
   propagate posts from handles of unreliable news sources sometime in the
   future is of utmost importance for early detection and prevention of
   disinformation diffusion in a network, and has yet to be explored. To
   that end, we present a novel task for predicting whether a user will
   repost content from Twitter handles of unreliable news sources by
   leveraging linguistic information from the user's own posts. We develop
   a new dataset of approximately 6.2K Twitter users mapped into two
   categories: (1) those that have reposted content from unreliable news
   sources; and (2) those that repost content only from reliable sources.
   For our task, we evaluate a battery of supervised machine learning
   models as well as state-of-the-art neural models, achieving up to 79.7
   macro F1. In addition, our linguistic feature analysis uncovers
   differences in language use and style between the two user categories.}},

Abstract = {{Although previous research has offered important insights into the
   consequences of mis- and disinformation and the effectiveness of
   corrective information, we know markedly less about how different types
   of corrective information - news media literacy interventions and
   fact-checkers - can be combined to counter different forms of
   misinformation. Against this backdrop, this paper reports on experiments
   in the US and the Netherlands (N = 1,091) that exposed people to
   evidence-based or fact-free anti-immigration misinformation,
   fact-checkers and/or a media literacy intervention. The main findings
   indicate that evidence-based misinformation is seen as more accurate
   than fact-free misinformation, and the combination of news media
   literacy interventions and fact-checkers is most effective in lowering
   issue agreement and perceived accuracy of misinformation across
   countries. These findings have important implications for journalism
   practice and policy makers that aim to combat mis- and disinformation.}},

   data and analysis of observed news sharing behaviors on social media.
   Using a media-as-resources perspective, we theorize that there are
   elective affinities between tabloid news and misinformation and
   disinformation behaviors on social media. Integrating four data sets we
   constructed during the 2017 UK election campaign-individual-level data
   on news sharing (N = 1,525,748 tweets), website data (N = 17,989 web
   domains), news article data (N = 641 articles), and data from a custom
   survey of Twitter users (N = 1313 respondents)-we find that sharing
   tabloid news on social media is a significant predictor of
   democratically dysfunctional misinformation and disinformation
   behaviors. We explain the consequences of this finding for the civic
   culture of social media and the direction of future scholarship on fake

   strategically frame the problem of disinformation in the absence of a
   pre-existing policy intervention. An emerging body of research shows
   that the activity of formally independent regulators is not necessarily
   limited to the implementation of delegated regulatory competencies. We
   discuss the implications of the activity of independent regulators for
   the fight against disinformation during the COVID-19 pandemic. We find

Abstract = {{The main objective of the research outlined in this paper is to
   understand how higher education students who are attending a Media and
   Communication bachelor's degree perceive some aspects related to fake
   news and online disinformation. To conduct this case study, information
   was collected using an online questionnaire and a focus group. In this
   paper, we present the results collected from the focus group and that
   cover several questions related to student's perceptions of fake news
   and online disinformation. The sample was composed of eight students who
   were attending the 2nd year of a bachelor's degree in Media and
   Communication in 2018/2019. The results emphasize that students are
   familiar with fake news and with what seems to motivate people to create
   and disseminate them. They are also aware of some specific
   characteristics of this type of news and can identify websites that
   usually publish false stories. Participants reveal that most of the
   manipulated news they have found are released on social media and
   suggest that the news and information they trust most are those they can
   get from printed media. The results obtained advocate that students are
   aware of the negative impact of the phenomenon and that education is the
   best way to prevent the dissemination of fake news}},

Journal = {{GLOBALIZATIONS}},
Abstract = {{The terms `fake news' and `alternative facts' have lost their shock
   value in today's public discourse and seem to have become part of our
   normal political vocabulary. Fake news, mis- and disinformation are not
   a problem of a particular country but are found in politics around the
   world. In this paper, I look at how disinformation appears as a problem
   for democracy. Empirically, this paper explores dominant patterns of
   argumentation with a focus on the US, Germany and Czechia. I discuss the
   themes of media literacy, hybrid warfare and the emergence of fringe
   media. This paper argues that more attention needs to be paid to the
   affectual dimension of why people share fake news. Even though there is
   no easy solution for dealing with fake news, a first step is to stop
   denouncing people for believing in fake news and putting all our hope in
   media literacy.}},

Abstract = {{Australian elections are digitising. Electronic ballots, electronic
   certified lists, electronic scrutiny, and electronic data are becoming
   part of the electoral status quo. The digitisation of elections in
   Australia induces new vulnerabilities that malign foreign entities can
   exploit to subvert the nation's democratic sovereignty. Problems such as
   inauthenticity, data insecurity, and disinformation are amplified in
   today's epoch of digital era governance. Since these problems have the
   potential to erode the legitimacy of Australian elections, it is
   imperative to deepen understanding of these risks to optimise the
   nation's democratic resilience. Through applying a conceptual framework
   derived from democratic theory and public policy, this paper assesses
   the vulnerability of Australia's elections to foreign interference based
   on the Australian electoral system irrespective of adversary
   capabilities. It finds that Australia's federal elections are relatively
   secure from hard cyber security risks due to digital-analogue hybridity
   in electoral processes, but they are vulnerable to soft cyber risks such
   as digital disinformation.}},

   delves into public opinion, pluralism and disinformation, and examines
   the reception of the disinformation in terms of moral systems and
   emotional responses. Specifically, a qualitative analysis is made of
   material posted on YouTube by two Venezuelan emigrant influencers about
   Juan Guaido's self-proclamation as acting president in January 2019. The
   focus is on the resources they use to establish themselves as discursive
   authorities about the political discussion from outside the country.}},

Journal = {{PERSONALITY AND INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{182}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{We examine how individual differences influence perceived accuracy of
   deepfake claims and sharing intention. Rather than political deepfakes,
   we use a non-political deepfake of a social media influencer as the
   stimulus, with an educational and a deceptive condition. We find that
   individuals are more likely to perceive the deepfake claim to be true
   when informative cues are missing along with the deepfake (compared to
   when they are present). Also, individuals are more likely to share
   deepfakes when they consider the fabricated claim to be accurate.
   Moreover, we find that cognitive ability plays a moderating role such
   that when informative cues are present (educational condition),
   individuals with high cognitive ability are less trustful of deepfake
   claims. Unexpectedly, when the informative cues are missing (deceptive
   condition), these individuals are more likely to consider the claim to
   be true and share them. The findings suggest that adding corrective
   labels can help reduce inadvertent sharing of disinformation. Also, user
   biases should be considered in understanding public engagement with
   disinformation.}},

Abstract = {{Although the phenomenon of disinformation and, specifically, fake news
   has become especially serious and problematic, this phenomenon has not
   been widely addressed in academia from the perspective of consumers, who
   play a relevant role in the spread of this content. For that reason, the
   present study focuses on determining how this phenomenon is perceived by
   citizens, as the strategies to counteract fake news are affected by such
   opinions. Thus, the main objective of this study was to identify in
   which media the perception and experience of fake news is greatest and
   thus determine what platforms should be focused on to counteract this
   phenomenon. A survey was conducted in October 2020, among the Spanish
   adult population and was completed by a total of 423 people (with 421
   valid answers). Among its main findings, this study determined that
   social media platforms are the type of media in which the greatest
   amount of fake news is perceived, which confirms the suggestions of
   previous studies. Furthermore, the experienced presence of fake news
   seems to be primarily affected by age and gender, as there was a higher
   level of skepticism observed among young people and women. Additionally,
   the use of media seems to be positively correlated with the perceived
   and experienced presence of fake news.}},

Abstract = {{Social media platforms are double-edged swords for the advancement of
   religious literacy. Platforms like YouTube, Twitter, and Facebook may
   enhance the discoverability of factual information about religion and
   promote the formation of online learning communities. However, these
   same platforms enable the formation of conspiratorial echo chambers and
   allow disinformation to spread widely and quickly. Without editors or
   gate keepers, information in the age of social media is spread through a
   disintermediated process. Thus, the advancement of religious literacy on
   social media platforms must involve scholars and teachers taking on the
   role of ``strategic amplifiers,{''} agents that amplify content that
   promotes religious literacy while being aware of the challenges these
   platforms present.}},

Journal = {{FUTURE INTERNET}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The dissemination of disinformation and fabricated content on social
   media is growing. Yet little is known of what the functional Twitter
   data analysis methods are for languages (such as Finnish) that include
   word formation with endings and word stems together with derivation and
   compounding. Furthermore, there is a need to understand which themes
   linked with misinformation-and the concepts related to it-manifest in
   different countries and language areas in Twitter discourse. To address
   this issue, this study explores misinformation and its related concepts:
   disinformation, fake news, and propaganda in Finnish language tweets. We
   utilized (1) word cloud clustering, (2) topic modeling, and (3) word
   count analysis and clustering to detect and analyze
   misinformation-related concepts and themes connected to those concepts
   in Finnish language Twitter discussions. Our results are two-fold: (1)
   those concerning the functional data analysis methods and (2) those
   about the themes connected in discourse to the misinformation-related
   concepts. We noticed that each utilized method individually has critical
   limitations, especially all the automated analysis methods processing
   for the Finnish language, yet when combined they bring value to the
   analysis. Moreover, we discovered that politics, both internal and
   external, are prominent in the Twitter discussions in connection with
   misinformation and its related concepts of disinformation, fake news,
   and propaganda.}},

Abstract = {{The discourse on the infodemic constructs the combination of the
   pandemic and disinformation as a new source of insecurity on a global
   scale. How can we make sense - analytically and politically - of this
   newly politicized nexus of public health, information management, and
   global security? This article proposes approaching the phenomenon of the
   infodemic as an intersecting securitization of information disorder and
   health governance. Specifically, it argues that there are two distinct
   frames of security mobilized in the context of infodemic governance:
   information as a disease and information as a weapon. Drawing on
   literatures on global health and the emerging research on
   disinformation, the paper situates the two framings of the infodemic in
   broader discourses on the medicalization of security, and securitization
   of information disorder, respectively. The article critically reflects
   on each framing and offers some preliminary thoughts on how to approach
   the entanglements of health, security, and information disorder in
   contemporary global politics.}},

   industry regulation}},
Journal = {{ARTNODES}},
Year = {{2019}},
Number = {{24}},
Pages = {{34-43}},
Abstract = {{This paper describes a research-based art project that seeks to identify
   several strategies used to delay industry regulation and manipulate
   public opinion during the 1980s and compare them to the strategies used
   by online advertising platforms such as Google and Facebook which are
   facing regulation today. This paper will show how these strategies have
   been woven into the story of a game called What remains, a darkly
   humorous, authentic Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) game aiming to
   create an experience of fighting misinformation, showing the player ways
   to push back and regain agency by joining forces with others and
   actively questioning the nature of different news media.
   Throughout the nineteen eighties, several strategies were tried and
   tested to manipulate public opinion in order to avoid regulation that
   was threatening industries such as oil and tobacco. Three strategies
   will be discussed with examples from the 1980s as well as from today's
   Tech Industry, which is facing potential regulation after the 2016 US
   elections and the Brexit referendum made it clear that there was a
   massive lack of accountability on the part of online advertising
   platforms. The November 2017 congressional hearings of Facebook, Twitter
   and Google, as well as the hearings of Marc Zuckerberg in the US and the
   EU in early 2018 are the main sources of information analyzed.
   This paper describes an art project that shows some of the most
   successful pre-internet disinformation campaigns and highlights how the
   online advertisement industry is utilizing them to stave off regulations
   threatening their business model, even if their business model is
   threatening democracy.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF UROLOGY}},
Year = {{2003}},
Volume = {{169}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{663-665}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: We reviewed and contrast with the literature the cumulative
   clinical experience at our pediatric urological division in the last 20
   years with managing testicular torsion, focusing specifically on the
   direction and degree of testicular torsion and the duration of symptoms
   before presentation. We also addressed the incidence of gastrointestinal
   symptoms, role of manual detorsion, residual torsion and incidence of
   atrophy.
   Materials and Methods: We reviewed the medical records of 200
   consecutive males 18 months to 20 years old who underwent surgical
   exploration by a pediatric urologist for a diagnosis of testicular
   torsion between 1980 and 2000.
   Results: Of 186 nonelective explorations symptoms were localized to the
   left side in 52\% and to the right side in 48\%. Information on the
   direction and degree of testicular rotation was available in 162 of 186
   cases (87\%) and anticipated medial rotation occurred in only 108
   (67\%). Lateral rotation in 54 of 162 cases (33\%) occurred in 28 of 84
   (33\%) with left torsion and in 26 of 78 (33\%) with right torsion. A
   median of 540 degrees of torsion (range 180 to 1,080) was noted in the
   70 orchiectomy cases (38\%) and a median of 360 degrees (range 180 to
   1,080) was noted in the 116 salvaged testes (62\%). Manual detorsion was
   attempted in 53 orchiopexy cases with residual torsion in 17 (32\%).
   Testicular atrophy developed in 27\% of the patients.
   Conclusions: The traditional teaching that testicular torsion occurs
   primarily in the medial direction is misleading since in a third of
   cases it occurs in the lateral direction. While manual detorsion should
   be guided by response and return of normal anatomy, surgical exploration
   remains necessary since residual torsion still poses a risk to
   testicular viability. Long-term followup is warranted to assess the true
   incidence of subsequent atrophy after the management of acute testicular
   torsion.}},

Abstract = {{Social media platforms can expose influential trends in many aspects of
   everyday life. However, the trends they represent can be contaminated by
   disinformation. Social bots are one of the significant sources of
   disinformation in social media. Social bots can pose serious cyber
   threats to society and public opinion. This research aims to develop
   machine learning models to detect bots based on the extracted user's
   profile from a Tweet's text. Online user profiles show the user's
   personal information, such as age, gender, education, and personality.
   In this work, the user's profile is constructed based on the user's
   online posts. This work's main contribution is three-fold: First, we aim
   to improve bot detection through machine learning models based on the
   user's personal information generated by the user's online comments. The
   similarity of personal information when comparing two online posts makes
   it difficult to differentiate a bot from a human user. However, in this
   research, we leverage personal information similarity among two online
   posts as an advantage for the new bot detection model. The new proposed
   model for bot detection creates user profiles based on personal
   information such as age, personality, gender, education from user's
   online posts, and introduces a machine learning model to detect social
   bots with high prediction accuracy based on personal information.
   Second, we create a new public data set that shows the user's profile
   for more than 6900 Twitter accounts in the Cresci 2017 {[}1] data set.
   All user's profiles are extracted from the online user's posts on
   Twitter. Third, for the first time, this paper uses a deep
   contextualized word embedding model, ELMO {[}2], for a social media bot
   detection task.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: The article examines how the new technologies and the
   internet have given society greater access to information and knowledge
   but have also led to a major increase in false information and lies,
   which constitute a serious threat to information ethics.
   Methodology: The author offers a taxonomy to describe the most common
   types of false information (misinformation, disinformation, missing
   information and self-deception) and information calumny, using examples
   in contemporary North American politics and information media and
   focusing on the figures of Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. The article
   analyses the role public institutions and information professionals
   should adopt to face the situation.
   Results: While they cannot themselves possess the truth, in order to
   combat false information and ignorance information professionals must
   remain alert to the dangers present, keep abreast of the demands of
   their profession, be competent and informed and promote society's
   information literacy at individual and collective levels.}},

Journal = {{JOURNALISM STUDIES}},

Pages = {{1323-1343}},

Abstract = {{During recent years, worries about fake news have been a salient aspect
   of mediated debates. However, the ubiquitous and fuzzy usage of the term
   in news reporting has led more and more scholars and other public actors
   to call for its abandonment in public discourse altogether. Given this
   status as a controversial but arguably effective buzzword in news
   coverage, we know surprisingly little about exactly how journalists use
   the term in their reporting. By means of a quantitative content
   analysis, this study offers empirical evidence on this question. Using
   the case of Austria, where discussions around fake news have been
   ubiquitous during recent years, we analyzed all news articles mentioning
   the term ``fake news{''} in major daily newspapers between 2015 and 2018
   (N = 2,967). We find that journalistic reporting on fake news shifts
   over time from mainly describing the threat of disinformation online, to
   a more normalized and broad usage of the term in relation to attacks on
   legacy news media. Furthermore, news reports increasingly use the term
   in contexts completely unrelated to disinformation or media attacks. In
   using the term this way, journalists arguably contribute not only to
   term salience but also to a questionable normalization process.}},

Journal = {{CIC-CUADERNOS DE INFORMACION Y COMUNICACION}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{26}},
Pages = {{77-87}},
Abstract = {{This article presents an approach to the phenomenon of visual
   disinformation with the intention of developing a taxonomy that
   classifies the techniques used in the production of false images in
   disinformative content related to COVID-19. Based on a sample of 80
   items of visual disinformative content related to the pandemic and its
   social consequences, extracted from informative websites, digital media
   and social networks. An inductive process has been developed on the
   sample in four phases: firstly, a collection and tracking, followed by
   the observation and interpretation of its contents, to classify them and
   finally obtain common referential patterns that can be extrapolated. In
   this way, we seek to establish current patterns that allow us to
   catalogue the techniques and processes of photographic manipulation. As
   a result, a taxonomy proposal has been obtained as a map of the tactics
   that have been mainly used for visual disinformation during the
   pandemic. Three primary classificatory segments are established: ex
   ante, ex facto and ex post manipulations, alluding to the time period in
   which the alteration of the (dis) informative photograph takes place.
   Finally, a second classificatory arrangement arises according to the
   exact typology of the manipulative technique employed. In conclusion,
   the role of photography in the disinformation that affects the current
   pandemic crisis is evident, highlighting the various manipulative paths
   that the image can take. The proposal aims to contribute to the wish of
   those who, in the face of this double pandemic, viral and
   disinformative, see the opportunity to reinforce a stronger media
   literacy.}},

Abstract = {{Luciano Floridi (2003) offers a theory of information as a ``strongly
   semantic{''} notion, according to which information encapsulates truth,
   thereby making truth a necessary condition for a sentence to qualify as
   ``information{''}. While Floridi provides an impressive development of
   this position, the aspects of his approach of greatest philosophical
   significance are its foundations rather than its formalization. He
   rejects the conception of information as meaningful data, which entails
   at least three theses - that information can be false; that tautologies
   are information; and, that ``It is true that...{''} is non- redundant -
   appear to be defensible. This inquiry offers various logical, epistemic,
   and ordinary-language grounds to demonstrate that an account of his kind
   is too narrow to be true and that its adoption would hopelessly obscure
   crucial differences between information, misinformation, and
   disinformation.}},

Abstract = {{Covid-19 has triggered not only a pandemic that endangers our social,
   economic, and health systems but also an infodemic resulting from the
   prolific spread of fake news, hoaxes, and misleading content. From a
   statistical-descriptive perspective and using content analysis, this
   research analyzes the information disorders, media language, and
   narratives that carry the disinformation generated about Covid-19 at an
   international level. The analysis focuses on determining its frequency
   of occurrence, based on the time it takes to be verified and
   establishing the relationship between the spread of the virus and the
   prevalence of disinformation on different continents. A sample of 582
   fake news items included in the International Fact-Checking Network
   (IFCN) database on the novel coronavirus was analyzed. This information
   was divided into a general sample made up of 511 pieces of
   disinformation and a specific one on fake news spread through WhatsApp
   (n=71). The results partially confirm recent studies that reported a
   greater prevalence of information that reconfigures legitimate content
   and takes longer to be verified than fully fabricated content.
   Disinformation in textual form predominates over the production of
   images and audios. Video content required longer verification times in
   comparison with the other media formats. Disinformation about Covid-19
   includes narratives with a dynamic and changing character as the
   pandemic expands. Likewise, a parallelism between the geographical
   evolution of the pandemic and the spread of the infodemic is detected,
   as well as specific disinformation patterns on WhatsApp, where more
   audio-based disinformation and a higher percentage of fabricated content
   is shared, sometimes for criminal purposes.}},

   based on tests conducted during the 2018 Brazilian elections. Through
   this it was possible to define and apply criteria to quickly reveal any
   potentially false content, while also showing the type of online news

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{BackgroundWith COVID-19 pandemic, the world has witnessed a scenario
   that is unique compared to any other such pandemic that the world has
   grappled with. This is primarily owing to the parallel infodemic that
   the population faced with disinformation and misinformation explosion in
   several platforms that an individual can access.Main bodyThe myriad of
   information that everyone in the world received acted as double-edged
   sword as some information helped individuals in allying the anxiety and
   stigma and motivated them for appropriate COVID-19 behavior; however, on
   the other hand, the same acted opposite and created a whole lot of
   negative problems in the community. The misinformation regarding the
   disease is not only limited to what has happened so far in the realm of
   prevention and control rather the same is also plaguing the efforts
   towards effective vaccine uptake.ConclusionWith the technological and
   media advancement, it is getting difficult to ward off every
   misinformation that is getting received at individual end which is
   obviously detrimental in the efforts toward effective vaccine
   acceptance; however, measures need to be taken at appropriate level to
   curb this menace of infodemic to relax the world from the clutch of this
   pandemic. This article looks at the impact of the misinformation and
   disinformation on psychological wellbeing and vaccine acceptance and
   suggests remedial measures.}},

Abstract = {{In the wake of the 2016 U.S. presidential election, the notion of ``fake
   news{''} and Russian election interference became somewhat
   interchangeable. We argue that ``fake news{''} insufficiently describes
   the Russian disinformation campaign. Our analysis of Facebook ad texts
   shows that they incorporate emotional appeals differently at unique
   moments in the political campaign of 2016. We use sentiment analysis to
   demonstrate the use of positive and negative emotional messages.
   Sentiment ratings dipped to more negative scores before the November
   2016 election and rose to new positive heights after the election. This
   provides some evidence that the varying uses of positive sentiment and
   negative sentiment may have been strategic.}},

Abstract = {{Internet-based media and social networks enable quick access to
   information; however, that has also made it easy to conduct
   disinformation campaigns. Fake news poses a serious threat to the
   functioning and safety of our society, as demonstrated by
   nation-state-sponsored campaigns to sway the 2016 US presidential
   election, and more recently COVID-19 pandemic hoaxes that promote false
   cures, putting lives at risk.
   FADE is a novel approach and service that helps Internet users detect
   fake news. FADE discovers multiple news sources covering the same story,
   analyzes their reputation, and checks the trustworthiness of cited
   sources. Our approach does not depend on any specific social media or
   news source, does not rely on costly textual content analysis, and does
   not require lengthy offline processing. Our experiments demonstrate
   above 85\% detection accuracy with a practical implementation. FADE
   offers a path to empowering the Internet community with effective tools

Abstract = {{Purpose
   The purpose of this paper selected by ICIL 2019 committee in Rome is to
   demonstrate the current importance of the internet in the protection of
   democracy in developting countries.
   Design/methodology/approach
   It is intended to make a comparison with the growing and current
   phenomenon of Brazilian disinformation with other contemporary phenomena
   related to new technologies through literature review methodology.
   Findings
   The Brazilian elections in 2018 represent an authentic model in a
   post-Cambridge Analytical phase where the myth of the sanctity of data
   has been broken. The big influence of the algorithmic revolution on
   democracies in Latin America has never been more evident. The misuse of
   algorithms created an artificial environment that does not put us in
   contact with different realities; the consequences of this conjuncture
   have the deepest impacts, especially in countries that rely on a
   deficient educational system.
   Originality/value
   The research about the impact that the phenomenon of disinformation has
   on underdeveloped countries, it is essential to analyze the new role of
   the legislator in the elaboration of hypercomplex laws with
   multi-stakeholder interests that respect the essential core of digital
   human rights as the freedom of expression online.}},

Abstract = {{Disinformation is challenging the constitutional guarantees of public
   opinion on the Internet, specifically on social networks. Technological
   measures cannot fully address this issue. It is required to rethink the
   fundamental right to information and expression and the public opinion
   process. The factors of time-space on the digital medium have been
   transformed: the value of time means ``attention{''} and the value of
   space is a viral effect. The dynamics of the Internet make information
   viral and visible and bring about changes to the contexts of messages.
   And those dynamics make the spreading of fake news easy. The content of
   the right to freedom of information and expression is increased by the
   ``right of contextualization{''}, which creates a new legal limit based
   on ``contextualization{''}. This, in addition to the algorithm
   respecting personal data protection (privacy), would help to weaken the
   impact of disinformation on public opinion.}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{A large-scale Cyber-Physical System (CPS) such as a smart grid usually
   provides service to a vast number of users as a public utility. Security
   is one of the most vital aspects in such critical infrastructures. The
   existing CPS security usually considers the attack from the information
   domain to the physical domain, such as injecting false data to damage
   sensing. Social Collective Attack on CPS (SCAC) is proposed as a new
   kind of attack that intrudes into the social domain and manipulates the
   collective behavior of social users to disrupt the physical subsystem.
   To provide a systematic description framework for such threats, we
   extend MITRE ATT\&CK, the most used cyber adversary behavior modeling
   framework, to cover social, cyber, and physical domains. We discuss how
   the disinformation may be constructed and eventually leads to physical
   system malfunction through the social-cyber-physical interfaces, and we
   analyze how the adversaries launch disinformation attacks to better
   manipulate collective behavior. Finally, simulation analysis of SCAC in
   a smart grid is provided to demonstrate the possibility of such an
   attack.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY \& POLITICS}},
Abstract = {{This study investigates the interaction and messaging tactics of
   political Twitter bots before an election. We analyzed the strategies of
   influential bots seeking to affect the immigration debate before the
   2018 U.S. midterm elections. Our findings reveal that the 10 most
   influential bots in our dataset all presented an anti-immigration
   viewpoint, and both posted original tweets and retweeted other bot
   accounts' tweets to give a false sense of authenticity and
   anti-immigration consensus. Bots' messages relied heavily on negative
   emotional appeals by spreading harassing language and disinformation
   likely intended to evoke fear toward immigrants. Such accounts also
   employed polarizing language to entrench political group identity and
   provoke partisanship. Our findings help to understand the interaction
   and messaging tactics employed by political bots and suggest potential
   strategies that may be employed to counter their effectiveness.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Most states with 24-h waiting periods prior to abortion
   provide state resource directories to women seeking abortion. Our
   objective was to evaluate the information on abortion provided on the
   websites of crisis pregnancy centers listed in these resource
   directories.
   Study design: We performed a survey of the websites of crisis pregnancy
   centers referenced in state resource directories for pregnant women. We
   searched for these state-provided resource directories online. We
   contacted state Departments of Health and Human Services for a print
   copy when a directory could not be found online. The crisis pregnancy
   center websites were evaluated for the information provided on abortion.
   Standardized data collection tools were used. Descriptive statistics
   were generated.
   Results: Resource directories of 12 states were procured. A total of 254
   websites referring to 348 crisis pregnancy centers were identified.
   Overall, a total of 203/254 {[}80\%, 95\% confidence interval (CI)
   75\%-84\%] of websites provided at least one false or misleading piece
   of information. The most common misleading or false information included
   on the websites were a declared link between abortion and mental health
   risks (122/254 sites; 48\%, 95\% CI 42\%-54\%), preterm birth (54/254;
   21\%, 95\% CI 17\%-27\%), breast cancer (51/254; 20\%, 95\% CI
   16\%-25\%) and future infertility (32/254; 13\%, 95\% CI 9\%-17\%).
   Conclusion: Most crisis pregnancy centers listed in state resource
   directories for pregnant women provide misleading or false information
   regarding the risks of abortion. States should not list agencies that
   provide inaccurate information as resources in their directories. (C)

Abstract = {{Rhetoric surrounding the fake news crisis suggests social media is a
   primary contributor, allowing a greater variety of channels through
   which information, presented as news, can be published for financial or
   ideological gain. However, the problem of fake or false news, now
   included in the broader term disinformation, has a much longer history
   than the digital era and was previously extensively published in
   mainstream media. This article takes an historical approach in order to
   contextualise the current plethora of disinformation through an
   indicative comparison of the spread and reach of two infamous fake news
   stories, a century apart. The results of this comparison indicate that
   the relative population reach of fake news is now less than in the
   pre-digital news media era and that digital media fragmentation and
   immediacy allow the identification and correction of fake news faster
   than in any other period in history. However, while such conditions
   offer a curative effect, they do not suggest a cure-all with the
   historical record further revealing an enduring legacy of information
   disruption that transcends preventative and corrective action.}},

Abstract = {{Disinformation and other forms of manipulative, antidemocratic
   communication have emerged as a problem for Internet policy. While such
   operations are not limited to electoral politics, efforts to influence

   digital advertising has played a key role in facilitating political
   manipulation campaigns. Rather than stand alone incidents, manipulation
   operations reflect systemic issues within digital advertising markets

   capacities they enable. At their root, these systems are designed to

Abstract = {{The diversity of news distributed via social media communication
   channels exposes citizens to large scale disinformation including
   misleading and false information. In this context of the massive use of
   social media and considering the EU Youth Strategy 2019-2027 with
   regards to democracy, there is a strong need for analytical skills. The
   main problem is the reduced level of commitment of people to evaluate
   social media news and to develop the proper analytical skills.
   This paper aims at exemplifying the utility of conducting survey-based
   primary research for identifying the most appropriate analytical skills
   for dealing with fake news. The research method consists of establishing
   and distributing a questionnaire targeting various categories of people.
   Feedback was collected through an online survey in 2020. The
   questionnaire included category questions aiming at analysing the
   responses from the age, youth category and time spent online
   perspective. This approach is thought to provide data of sufficient
   quality and quantity to meet the objective of identifying the most
   appropriate analytical skills for dealing with fake news.
   The results of this study emphasize the views of respondents with
   regards to fake news approach, the extent to which various categories of
   people are checking the news before sharing, as well as the preferred
   criteria used for verifying the correctness of the news from social
   media. Based on the analysis of the results, the author proposed a set
   of solutions to empower youth to evaluate fake news and to detect
   disinformation campaigns across social networks.}},

Abstract = {{To actually buy environmentally friendly products, consumers need to
   recognize legitimate sustainable claims. This is a challenge considering
   the dissemination of misinformation in advertising promoting sustainable
   products typically referred to as greenwashing. In an experimental
   design (N = 302) we investigated two different advertising literacy
   measures that aim at increasing literacy about greenwashing: an
   informative text (text condition), or an informative text plus a quiz
   game (quiz condition). We compared these two literacy measures to a
   control group that received no literacy intervention. Afterwards we
   measured participants' greenwashing literacy and their confidence in
   being able to perceive greenwashing strategies. Both advertising
   literacy measures significantly increased participants' greenwashing
   literacy. Yet, participants' confidence in recognizing greenwashing was
   decreased in the quiz condition. Still, our study points to quiz-based
   literacy interventions as the most promising measure as it increases
   consumers' formal knowledge, but also might keep them humble and
   therefore critical in the long run.}},

Abstract = {{This study focuses on the sloganization of the political discourse on
   Covid-19 and borders during the first months of the pandemic. First, it
   reviews how borders have been managed to prevent the spread of the
   virus. Next, the concepts of disinformation and propaganda are briefly
   discussed as phenomena that have implicitly underpinned the expansion
   and research of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and the phenomenon of
   sloganization is described from the theoretical perspective of framing.
   Finally, two cases of sloganized discourse are analyzed: ``The Chinese
   virus{''} and ``This virus knows no borders{''}, through the qualitative
   content analysis (QCA). The analysis shows that both cases oversimplify
   the complexity of pandemic management, cover up controversial decisions,
   and centrifuge responsibilities. The conclusions underline how the
   sloganization of the political discourse can be located in a border area
   between propaganda and disinformation, and the gestation mechanisms as
   well as the conceptual and formal characteristics of the slogans are
   systematized to approach them from the critical literacy.}},

Title = {{Competing propagandas: How the United States and Russia represent mutual
   propaganda activities}},
Journal = {{POLITICS}},
Abstract = {{The period of growing tensions between the United States and Russia
   (2013-2019) saw mutual accusations of digital interference,
   disinformation, fake news, and propaganda, particularly following the
   Ukraine crisis and the 2016 US presidential election. This article asks
   how the United States and Russia represent each other's and their own
   propaganda, its threat, and power over audiences. We examine these
   representations in US and Russian policy documents and online articles
   from public diplomacy media Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) and
   RT. The way propaganda is framed, (de)legitimized, and securitized has
   important implications for public understanding of crises, policy
   responses, and future diplomacy. We demonstrate how propaganda threats
   have become a major part of the discourse about the US-Russia
   relationship in recent years, prioritizing state-centred responses and
   disempowering audiences.}},

Abstract = {{Waged in 2016, Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte's war on drugs has
   claimed over 20,000 lives according to human rights groups. The Duterte
   administration's own count is significantly lower: around 6,000. The
   huge discrepancy between the government's official count and that of
   arguably more impartial organizations about something as concretely
   material as body count is symptomatic of how disinformation is central
   to the Duterte administration and how it can sustain the approval of the
   majority of the Philippine electorate. We suggest that Duterte's
   populist politics generates what Boler and Davis (2018) call ``affective
   feedback loops,{''} which create emotional and informational ecosystems
   that facilitate smooth algorithmic governance. We turn to Patron Saints
   of Nothing, a recently published novel by Randy Ribay about a
   Filipino-American who goes back to the Philippines to uncover the truth
   behind the death of his cousin. Jay's journey into the ``heart of
   darkness{''} as a ``hyphenated{''} individual (Filipino-American) allows
   him access to locally networked subjectivities but not its affective
   entanglements. Throughout the novel, he encounters numerous versions of
   the circumstances of Jun's demise and the truth remains elusive at the
   end of the novel. We argue that despite the constant distortion of fact
   and fiction in the novel, what remains relatively stable or ``sticky{''}
   throughout the novel are the letters from Jun Reguero that Jay carries
   with him back to the Philippines. We suggest that these letters can
   potentially serve as a form of ``dissensus{''} that challenges the
   constant redistribution of the sensible in the novel.}},

Abstract = {{Research on the reasons for the unexpected outcome of the 2019 national
   election in India can be divided into two strands: one strand examines
   the election without recourse to media, arguing that the appeals by
   parties to different segments of the population, referred to as identity
   politics, swayed voters. The other strand has made the case that media
   campaigns, and digital media in particular, were decisive in shaping the
   electoral outcome. Among the explanations that focus on media, these can
   be further subdivided into those that make the case for traditional
   media still playing a more important role than online media, and others
   that argue that digital media, and perhaps even online disinformation,
   played a key role. In this paper, we analyze the evidence for these
   competing accounts, drawing on the available evidence. We argue that an
   explanation based on combining elements from both strands, plus the
   interaction between digital media and traditional media and offline
   mobilization, together explain Modi's unanticipated election victory.}},

Abstract = {{Dark participation is and should be an essential concept for scholars,
   students and beyond, considering how widespread disinformation, online
   harassment, hate speech, media manipulation etc. has become in
   contemporary society. This commentary engages with the contributions to
   this timely thematic issue, which advance scholarship into dark
   participation associated with news and misinformation as well as hate in
   a worthwhile way. The commentary closes with a call for further research
   into four main areas: 1) the motivations that drive dark participation
   behaviors by individuals and coordinated groups; 2) how these
   individuals and groups exploit platforms and technologies for diverse
   forms of dark participation; 3) how news publishers, journalists,
   fact-checkers, platform companies and authorities are dealing with dark
   participation; and 4) how the public can advance their media literacy
   for digital media in order to better deal with dark participation.
   Authorities must advance and broaden their approaches focused on schools
   and libraries, and may also use emerging technologies in doing so.}},

   Valerie has played an important role for the final polishing of the
   article. Second, it is a great honor to me that Thorsten Quandt invited
   me to author this commentary. Mats Ekstrom and I were intellectually
   stimulated when processing the original article on dark participation by
   Quandt for the thematic issue we guest edited for Media and
   Communication in 2018. As I have said numerous times elsewhere, this is
   an exceptional article with a much-needed critical perspective and
   exciting multi-level rhetoric, and it should and surely will impact
   research and higher education for many years to come. In extension of
   this, I envision this thematic issue will be well received by scholars.

   imperfect and can be detected by the attacker independently. In order to
   detect the false targets the attacker allocates part of his budget into

Abstract = {{Many of us may be unknowingly suffering from information disorder
   syndrome. It is more prevalent due to the digitized world where the
   information flows to every individual's phone, tablet and computer in no
   time. Information disorder syndrome is the sharing or developing of
   false information with or without the intent of harming and they are
   categorized as misinformation, disinformation and malinformation. The
   severity of the syndrome is categorized into three grades. Grade 1 is a
   milder form in which the individual shares false information without the
   intent of harming others. Grade 2 is a moderate form in which the
   individual develops and shares false information with the intent of
   making money and political gain, but not with the intent of harming
   people. Grade 3 is a severe form in which the individual develops and
   shares false information with the intent of harming others. The
   management of this disorder requires the management of false
   information, which is rumor surveillance, targeted messaging and
   community engagement. Repeated sufferers at the Grade 1 level, all
   sufferers from grade 2 and 3 levels need psycho-social counseling and
   sometimes require strong regulations and enforcement to control such
   information disorder. The most critical intervention is to be mindful of
   the fact that not all posts in social media and news are real, and need
   to be interpreted carefully.}},

Abstract = {{This text aims to take a picture of the current situation of
   verification in Europe by studying several European fact-checkers. With
   the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic, it has also been studied how
   it has affected the work of verifiers. To do this, a content analysis of
   the information they publish is carried out, trying to find similarities
   between the initiatives and seeking to understand the nature and
   characteristics of the misinformation with which they work. In addition,
   interviews with professional verifiers and fact-checking specialists
   will allow us to understand their routines, methodologies, and business
   structures, trying again to establish convergences in the European
   scenario. An attempt will also be made to see how the disinformation
   crisis caused by the coronavirus has affected these media. In the end we
   find constant activity and similarities in the contents and
   methodologies. Social networks (58\% of content) and politics (68\% of
   pieces) as the main routes and themes for disinformation in Europe.
   Fact-checking as a feasible outlet for journalists, although it does not
   bring great benefits for companies. Finally, the coronavirus health
   crisis has led to an increase in the work of these initiatives (In most
   cases it has meant a double increase in published pieces).}},

Abstract = {{Advances in deepfake technology have led to the emergence of a new
   picture of how doctored material will be used in disinformation
   campaigns. While safeguards ensure that manipulated videos may not be
   such a problem at the highest levels of security and defence, lower
   levels - such as local elections - remain vulnerable to malign actors.
   At such levels, deepfakes can be distributed using social media channels
   to target unsuspecting victims. Current solutions only protect
   individuals who are prominent enough to be covered by the mainstream
   media, and not enough is being done by governments or social media
   companies to protect ordinary users from coordinated inauthentic
   activity online. However, with more images and videos of ourselves
   online than ever before, anyone can be a victim of a disinformation
   campaign. As deepfakes become easier to make, no one is safe -
   hyper-localized manipulation will create problems for democratic
   institutions that have not yet been fully understood.}},

Journal = {{VIVAT ACADEMIA}},
Year = {{2022}},

Pages = {{23-38}},
Abstract = {{Fake news has become a problem in the general information society and
   owes its preeminence, to a large extent, to the democratisation of
   social networks and the polarisation of different kinds of forces. But
   beyond the digital channels, there is a public, in this case of a
   local-provincial nature, which follows the news as it has traditionally
   done: mainly through its newspaper of reference, in print. This paper
   analyses, quantitatively and qualitatively, the contents related to fake
   news appearing in the printed version of Diario Informacion, between 3
   February 2020, the start of the US election campaign and the appearance
   of the first case of coronavirus in Spain, two clear events that lead
   directly to fake news in origin or destination, until 21 January 2021,
   the latter day following the start of the Joe Biden era. The aim is to
   try to find out whether the acerbic debate and the prominence of fake
   news in digital channels have a proportional transfer to the pages of
   this newspaper and whether they are priority issues for the reader. The
   study makes it clear that, compared to the bombardment and noise
   surrounding fake news in social media, in the print press there is a
   predominance of calm reflection, analysis of the problem and a clear and
   endorsed denunciation of this type of message. And what is more
   important: it is almost no news for the paper.}},

Abstract = {{Astroturfing, or the orchestration of manipulative propaganda campaigns,

   Exploring an astroturf attack as a paracrisis, this research
   investigates the effects of an attack and how proactive communication
   strategies can protect organizational outcomes (i.e., credibility,
   crisis responsibility, account acceptance, and organizational
   reputation). An online experiment using a U.S. adult sample (N = 597)
   was conducted to compare the effects of using pre-bunking, PR
   supportive, and strategic silence strategies. The study provides
   insights into advancing crisis communication theory by demonstrating the
   success of pre-bunking to thwart potential damage post-astroturf attack.
   In addition to expanding theoretical crisis response models, this
   research offers practitioners with advice that emphasizes the use of
   proactive strategies to pre-bunk disinformation.}},

Abstract = {{Science is a factfinding practice, but there are many other factfinding
   practices that apply largely the same patterns of reasoning in order to
   achieve as reliable information as possible in empirical issues. The
   factfinding practices form in their turn a subcategory of rational
   discourse, a wider category that also encompasses argumentation on
   nonempirical issues. Based on these categories, it is easy to see the
   relationship between on the one hand pseudoscience, and on the other
   hand fact resistance, disinformation, and fallacies of reasoning. The
   flaws in argumentation are similar, and the main difference is whether
   or not the subject matter falls within or without the realm of science.}},

Abstract = {{As digital platforms have come to play a central role in the news and
   information ecosystem, a new realm of watchdog journalism has emerged -
   the platform beat. Journalists on the platform beat report on the
   operation, use and misuse of social media platforms and search engines.
   The platform beat can serve as an important mechanism for increasing the
   accountability of digital platforms, in ways that can affect public
   trust in the platforms, but that can also, hopefully, lead to the
   development of stronger, more reliable, and ultimately more trustworthy,
   platforms. However, there are a number of tensions, vulnerabilities and
   potential conflicts of interest that characterize the platform beat.
   This article explores these complex dynamics of the platform beat in an
   effort assess the capacity of those on the platform beat to enhance the
   accountability and trustworthiness of digital platforms.}},

   surveys conducted among 310 climate change-denying American adults, and
   337 climate change believers, this study investigated these points with
   a few surprising results. As expected, climate change deniers displayed
   significantly lower levels of trust in the scientific community and the
   EPA than did climate change believers. Furthermore, commonly noted
   points of attack used by climate change disinformation efforts were
   found to have been accepted by climate change deniers, and disturbingly,
   in some cases by climate change believers as well. Implications for
   public relations scholars and practitioners are discussed (117 words).}},

Abstract = {{Once described as ``the consummate environmental insider,{''} Gus Speth,
   co-founder of the Natural Resources Defense Council, says that green
   organizations, politicians, and the media are failing to address the
   root causes of climate change and other environmental problems. He
   points the finger at what he calls the ``economic growth
   imperative{''}-the incessant quest for wealth by corporations,
   governments, and individuals-and argues for decoupling job growth from
   economic growth. Speth envisions a post-growth society in which
   renewable energy plays an important role, but the emphasis is on
   improved efficiency: an energy-sipping, rather than an energy-guzzling,
   society. He reflects on the politicization and polarization that
   destroyed a national consensus for action on climate change. Speth urges
   environmental groups not to settle for meager progress in Washington,
   but rather to challenge the political system and to build broad
   coalitions with groups working for social justice and political reform.}},

Title = {{`Fake News' in Science Communication: Emotions and Strategies of Coping
   with Dissonance Online}},
Journal = {{MEDIA AND COMMUNICATION}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{206-217}},
Abstract = {{In view of events such as the public denial of climate change research
   by well-known politicians, the effects of postfactual disinformation and
   emotionalisation are discussed for science. Here, so-called `fake news'
   are of focus. These are considered problematic, particularly in a
   high-choice media environment as users tend to show selective behaviour.
   Much research has demonstrated this selective exposure approach, which
   has roots in the Theory of Cognitive Dissonance (Festinger, 1957).
   However, research on the processes of coping with dissonance is still
   considered sparse. In particular, communication scholars have overlooked
   emotional states and negotiations. This article analyses the affects
   that are aroused when users are confronted with opinion-challenging
   disinformation and how they (emotionally) cope by using different
   strategies for online information. For this, we used the context of
   climate change that is widely accepted in Germany. The innovative
   research design included pre- and post-survey research, stimulus
   exposure (denying `fake news'), observations, and retrospective
   interviews (n = 50). Through this, we find that perceptions and coping
   strategies vary individually and that overt behaviour, such as searching
   for counter-arguments, should be seen against the background of
   individual ideas and motivations, such as believing in an easy rejection
   of arguments. Confirming neuroscientific findings, participants felt
   relieved and satisfied once they were able to dissolve their dissonant
   state and negative arousal. Dissatisfaction and frustration were
   expressed if this had not been accomplished.}},

   information. Even though extant literature has provided theoretical
   arguments for a discursive affinity between false or deceptive
   information and uncivil speech, we lack empirical evidence on whether
   and how false information and incivility converge. Against this
   backdrop, we rely on an extensive content analysis of fact-checked
   statements in the US (N = 894) to assess to what extent and how
   different forms of incivility are present in different degrees of false
   information. Our main findings illustrate that partisan attacks,
   negativity, and hate speech are most likely to occur in false
   information that deviates furthest from reality. These findings help us
   to dissect different degrees of untruthfulness based on their content
   features: Disinformation (goal-directed deception) may be distinguished
   from misinformation (unintentionally misleading content) based on the
   centrality of hostility, partisan attacks, and hate speech in the
   former.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENCE AND COUNTERINTELLIGENCE}},
Abstract = {{One of the most interesting thematic areas in intelligence studies is
   the study of the activities of the numerous double agents that had a
   significant impact on events and processes in the history of human
   conflicts and wars. Being a double agent is a highly demanding activity
   on both personal and professional levels. Examining the Cold War
   archives of former communist secret policies in Poland and Croatia, the
   authors integrated data showing that Ante Jerkov, an Italian journalist
   of Croatian origin with a parallel Ustasha and communist background, was
   an agent of influence and a source of information for at least five
   different intelligence and counterintelligence agencies. He worked for
   several agencies simultaneously. Additionally, he participated as part
   of a more comprehensive network of journalists who offered and sold
   information to different secret services in Rome/the Vatican during the
   Cold War. This article is a short biography of Ante Jerkov and his life
   in intelligence lies and deception.}},

Abstract = {{This study explores youth accuracy judgments of disinformative and

   representative youth (16-20 years old) survey experiment conducted in
   the Czech Republic in 2017. When they were exposed to posts regarding
   refugee crisis, young people were asked to judge the accuracy of the
   statements accompanying the posts. Motivated reasoning of youth depended
   primarily on the alignment with the posts and the ideology of
   participants. Results of this research suggest that motivated reasoning
   works differently for liberals and conservatives. Perceived amount of
   media literacy training does not seem to affect directional motivation.
   General trust works as moderator of motivated reasoning and, in
   combination with ideology, appears to be important for understanding
   directional motivation when exposed to disinformation.}},

Journal = {{NEURAL COMPUTING \& APPLICATIONS}},
Abstract = {{Recent progress in the area of modern technologies confirms that
   information is not only a commodity but can also become a tool for
   competition and rivalry among governments and corporations, or can be
   applied by ill-willed people to use it in their hate speech practices.
   The impact of information is overpowering and can lead to many socially
   undesirable phenomena, such as panic or political instability. To
   eliminate the threats of fake news publishing, modern computer security
   systems need flexible and intelligent tools. The design of models
   meeting the above-mentioned criteria is enabled by artificial
   intelligence and, above all, by the state-of-the-art neural network
   architectures, applied in NLP tasks. The BERT neural network belongs to
   this type of architectures. This paper presents Transformer-based hybrid

Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{The fake news crisis points to a complex set of circumstances in which
   new media ecologies struggle to address challenges related to
   authenticity, rhetorical manipulation and disinformation, and the
   inability of traditional educational models to adequately teach toward
   critical information literacy. While social media sites such as Facebook
   acknowledge the culpability of their platforms in spreading fake news,
   and create new strategies for addressing this problem, such measures are
   woefully inadequate. Wikipedia, nearing its 20th year, however, has
   developed numerous practices and policies to ensure information validity
   and verifiability. This article explores the connection between
   participation in the Wikipedia community, the development of critical
   information literacies, and the ability to navigate the current new
   media landscape. Analysis and review of Wikipedia's community policies
   and the procedures resulting from these policies demonstrate the
   encyclopedia's unique capacity to protect against problematic
   information. We ultimately argue that Wikipedia has become and remains
   one of the few places on the internet dedicated to combating fake news,
   and make recommendations on how to leverage Wikipedia practices and
   policies for information validation outside of the encyclopedia.}},

Abstract = {{Taiwan's exceptionally high Internet penetration and social media
   adoption rates, combined with the growing centrality of digital tools
   and networks in shaping national politics, make it an interesting case
   for Internet researchers. This essay considers Andrew Chadwick's notion
   ofThe Hybrid Media Systemin the context of recent political events in
   Taiwan. While Chadwick's analysis is particularly useful in
   understanding political anomalies like the Sunflower Movement, we argue
   for the value of considering more substantial long-standing structural
   issues in attempts to understanding the political media landscape in
   Taiwan. Using the examples of online astroturfing during political
   campaigns and the spread of disinformation during the Kansai airport
   incident, we point out that long-standing structural factors such as the
   dysfunctional practices of journalists in newsrooms, the clear political
   slants of media in accordance with media ownership, and the traditional
   political power rooted in the society hold enduring sway on how politics
   is mediated.}},

Abstract = {{The pandemic has had a profound impact on individuals' lives. But there
   is a sector in society that appears to have most suffered the
   consequences of the rules imposed to contain the spread of the virus, it
   is the generation of pre-adolescents and adolescents. They have been
   forced to physical isolation, e-learnig, without any possibility of
   aggregation and community life. Young people who live through the web a
   dimension of exasperated vetrinization of their lives centered on the
   concept of a performative self to obtain the approval of their audience.
   They adopt real self-representation strategies that include the use of
   false profiles and seem to suggest a path of adaptation to the
   disinformative and manipulatory context in which we are increasingly
   immersed. Starting from these elements, the article intends to explore,
   with the support of data collected in recent surveys, what impact the
   phenomena underway may have on the dynamics that contribute to the
   formation of social capital. In fact, there is a key component of the
   very definition of social capital which is highly fragile. I refer to
   the role of trust as investigated by Giddens, Beck, Fukyama and Luhman
   who attribute it as a key element for the development and survival of
   society. Where we are witnessing the proliferation of entropy dynamics
   of the experience of the social world deriving precisely from the

Abstract = {{In certification elections, workers consider the purchase of union
   services whose quality is, ex ante, unobservable. Voters must rely on
   available signals or indices in forming their expectations. Union
   members are able to reevaluate their initial purchase decision as more
   accurate information is obtained through experience. Therefore,
   participants in decertification elections rely less on soul-ces of
   imperfect information. Using NLRB data over the period 1966 to 1990, we
   find evidence consistent with information-related distinctions between
   the certification and decertification decisions. Our study provides a
   useful framework for understanding the observed differences between
   these two types of elections.}},

   Design/methodology/approach: A review of original papers and reviews of

   Findings: The COVID-19 pandemic has challenged the public with
   information overload related to SARS-CoV-2. Some of this information may
   be false and potentially harmful. The rapid spread of information
   reaching a wide audience is also a threat.
   Research limitations/implications: The subject of COVID-19 is still
   unknown and is under constant research, there are many new publications
   that we are not able to include and this publication needs to be
   updated.
   Originality/value: We have not found a similar publication on this

Abstract = {{Since declaration of post-truth as Oxford Dictionaries' word of the year
   in 2016, studies show that `fake news', `alternative facts', and
   disinformation have continued unabated - and even increased. Fingers
   have pointed at individuals such as Donald Trump and the activities of
   Russian `troll farms'. Also, global outrage has risen in relation to the
   deceptive and manipulative practices of organisations such as Cambridge
   Analytica and social media oligopolies, notably Facebook. However,
   transdisciplinary research challenges the `few bad apples' argument and
   proposes that a wide range of culprits are responsible for what this
   study calls post-communication. Based on a review of reports related to
   public communication practices, and key informant interviews, this
   discussion proposes that reforms are required at three levels: top-down,
   such as updated regulation and legislation; bottom-up, including new
   approaches to media literacy; and increased attention to ethics and
   standards by professionals in advertising, marketing, public relations,
   government and political communication, and journalism.}},

Month = {{MAY-JUN}},
Abstract = {{Fake news constitutes a significant part of one of the most complex
   problems that affect the flows of information in contemporary society:
   disinformation. Although this is not a recent phenomenon, the political
   and social consequences of the spreading of fake news on the internet
   have been thoroughly discussed in the last couple of years. Currently
   young people are the group with greater exposition to this reality due
   to the prevalence of communication technologies in their daily lives. On
   this article we review the literature on disinformation and analyse the
   longstanding relationship between false news and journalism, focusing on
   the particularities of the present situation. Using quantitative
   methodology, we conducted a survey to analyse the perceptions regarding
   fake news of 602 students (17-25 years-old) from higher education in
   Portugal. Our findings reveal a group that is clearly used to getting
   information online and has already contacted with fake news. However,
   different conceptions about what is fake news coexist, including
   erroneous ones. Hence, this study reaffirms the importance of media and
   information literacies, particularly the importance of raising awareness
   on credibility assessment, fact checking and the particularities of the
   information flows.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a discussion of some of the issues associated with
   the multiple sources of uncertainty and non-stationarity in the analysis
   and modelling of hydrological systems. Different forms of aleatory,
   epistemic, semantic, and ontological uncertainty are defined. The
   potential for epistemic uncertainties to induce disinformation in
   calibration data and arbitrary non-stationarities in model error
   characteristics, and surprises in predicting the future, are discussed
   in the context of other forms of non-stationarity. It is suggested that
   a condition tree is used to be explicit about the assumptions that
   underlie any assessment of uncertainty. This also provides an audit
   trail for providing evidence to decision makers.}},

Abstract = {{Based on interviews with 25 investigative journalists in Beijing, China,
   this study suggests digital journalists may be increasingly challenged
   by a sense of ``information overload{''} as they navigate social media
   and online environments crowded with dis- and mis-information, fake
   profiles and sources, and massive amounts of opinion journalism that is
   presented as professional journalism. This overload has reinforced
   Chinese investigative journalists' dedication to a conventional form of
   verification: meeting face-to-face with sources. This study contributes
   to scholarship on Chinese journalism by expanding knowledge about
   investigative journalists in the country and by complicating
   understandings of how journalists there work in an age of social media,
   disinformation, and increased interests in verification.}},

   contemporary and emerging information literacy frameworks, and outlining
   the current efforts and initiatives exercised by libraries to refute the
   spread of fake news and educate communities on how to navigate through
   an era of untruth and disinformation. The paper outlines effective
   initiatives developed by those within the Library and Information

   recommendations as to how librarians can continue to enhance their role

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{15}},
Pages = {{2693-2709}},
Abstract = {{Various emerging digital information societies like India exercise
   Internet shutdowns and information blackouts regularly as a way of
   dealing with different kinds of crises. These blackouts are justified as
   countering the misinformation cycles that amplify (dis)information that
   we have come to characterize as ``fake news.{''} An immersive
   ethnography during an Internet shutdowns in India revealed these
   blackouts are neither absolute nor foolproof because blackouts have
   multiple back doors that allow different kinds of information to flow
   through networked and social negotiations. I argue that Internet
   shutdowns need to be seen as specific exercises of geopolitical and
   sovereign power and read as performative because they are both
   inefficient and ineffective in achieving information blackouts. Making a
   distinction between misinformation and disinformation, I show how these
   Internet shutdowns do not stop the circulation of fake news but, as
   infrastructural tools, they enable state (dis)information and propaganda
   to spread without resistance and thus become potent tools in curbing
   protests and rightful critique of authoritarian practices.}},

Abstract = {{The COVID-19 epidemic is considered as the global health crisis of the
   whole society and the greatest challenge mankind faced since World War
   Two. Unfortunately, the fake news about COVID-19 is spreading as fast as
   the virus itself. The incorrect health measurements, anxiety, and hate
   speeches will have bad consequences on people's physical health, as well
   as their mental health in the whole world. To help better combat the
   COVID-19 fake news, we propose a new fake news detection dataset
   MM-COVID1 (Multilingual and Multidimensional COVID-19 Fake News Data
   Repository). This dataset provides the multilingual fake news and the
   relevant social context. We collect 3981 pieces of fake news content and
   7192 trustworthy information from English, Spanish, Portuguese, Hindi,
   French and Italian, 6 different languages. We present a detailed and
   exploratory analysis of MM-COVID from different perspectives.}},

Abstract = {{Malign influence campaigns leveraging cyber capabilities have caused
   significant political disruption in the United States and elsewhere; but
   the next generation of campaigns could be considerably more damaging as
   a result of the widespread use of machine learning.
   Current methods for successfully waging these campaigns depend on
   labour-intensive human interaction with targets. The introduction of
   machine learning, and potentially artificial intelligence (AI), will
   vastly enhance capabilities for automating the reaching of mass
   audiences with tailored and plausible content. Consequently, they will
   render malicious actors even more powerful.
   Tools for making use of machine learning in information operations are
   developing at an extraordinarily rapid pace, and are becoming rapidly
   more available and affordable for a much wider variety of users. Until
   early 2018 it was assumed that the utilisation of AI methods by cyber
   criminals was not to be expected soon, because those methods rely on
   vast datasets, correspondingly vast computational power, or both, and
   demanded highly specialised skills and knowledge. However, in 2019 these
   assumptions proved invalid, as datasets and computing power were
   democratised and freely available tools obviated the need for special
   skills. It is reasonable to assume that this process will continue,
   transforming the landscape of deception, disinformation and influence
   online.
   This article assesses the state of AI-enhanced cyber and information
   operations in late 2019 and investigates whether this may represent the
   beginnings of substantial and dangerous trends over the next decade.
   Areas to be considered include: social media campaigns using deepfakes;
   deepfake-enabled CEO fraud; machine-generated political astroturfing;
   and computers responding to the emotional state of those interacting
   with them, enabling automated, artificial humanoid disinformation
   campaigns.}},

Journal = {{COMMUNICATION \& SOCIETY-SPAIN}},

Abstract = {{The article addresses the issue of the presence of false information on
   coronavirus in the Polish news media between January and September 2020.
   The research aimed to check the extent to which traditional media
   participate in disinformation processes during the pandemic. An attempt
   has also been made at explaining the reasons for the publication of fake
   news in these media. Sources of information that Poles use most often
   were examined: popular information portals, traditional media websites,
   and social media (Facebook and Twitter). The article analyses false
   information in both quantitative and qualitative terms. A total of 101
   pieces of false information made available online were diagnosed, of
   which every fourth news item (25.74\%) appeared in opinion-forming media
   (three most popular news portals and all traditional media were taken
   into account). The qualitative analysis shows that publishing false
   information in the opinion-forming media is the result of changes in the
   journalistic work environment (especially declining standards of work, a
   desire to attract the attention of the media audience and the pursuit of
   the media organisations' own interests). However, this issue requires
   further research in editorial offices and among journalists.}},

Title = {{Raising awareness against fake news to protect democracy: the myth of
   Islamophobia in Trump's speech}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL SEMIOTICS}},
Abstract = {{Fake news is being disseminated rapidly and it is discussed constantly
   on social media through ``likes{''}, sharing and comments. Fake news
   undermined the contribution of media and gives space to powerful
   institution and specific parties to promote their policies as given. In
   this paper, I discuss that in order to understand in depth the fake
   news/disinformation, a phenomenon that threats democracy, each citizen
   should have the ability to connect the context, the words, the image and
   the extralinguistic features in order to ``read{''} behind the lines and
   identify the intentions that are hidden. To support this claim, a
   specific excerpt from fake news by Donald Trump is being analysed
   thoroughly with the combination of Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) and
   Social Semiotics (SS). From the analysis it is shown that not fake news
   merely, but rather elaborated myths are being constructed which
   attribute characteristics in social groups, in order to serve specific
   goals.}},

   ascertain the degree of credibility that young users in Andalucia give
   to information, this study presents the results of the evaluation of
   online news by university students pursuing degrees in communication and
   education (N=188), using the CRAAP test. The data reveal differences in
   gender and degree programme in the credibility assigned to the news. The
   conclusion is that university students have difficulty differentiating

   and ethical use of information, as well as the structures that promote
   actions based on citizenship, committed to a common good. The leading

Title = {{Far right alternative news media as `indignation mobilization
   mechanisms': how the far right opposed the Global Compact for Migration}},
Journal = {{INFORMATION COMMUNICATION \& SOCIETY}},
Abstract = {{The paper analyses the role of alternative far-right media in promoting
   and organizing mobilization against the Global Compact for Migration -
   the first intergovernmentally negotiated agreement, prepared under the
   auspices of the United Nations, covering all dimensions of international
   migration in a holistic and comprehensive manner. Exploring four
   European alternative far-right media: PI-News in Germany, Il Primato
   Nazionale in Italy, the UK localization of Breitbart, and the
   transnational Voice of Europe, we show that these media have gone beyond
   (dis)informing and have actively mobilized and channeled indignation
   through petitioning and protest organization. While most research on
   far-right media practices so far has focused either on social media
   interactions or exclusively on `disinformation' and `fake news', we
   analyse web based alternative news media as part of a far-right social
   movement that has successfully used progressive left-wing protests
   repertoires and tactics. We argue that alternative far-right news media
   act as `indignation mobilization mechanisms' that not only fuel the
   indignation of the public by channeling the messages of far-right
   politicians but also channel bottom-up indignation through online
   campaigns, petitions, and offline street protests. This unabashedly
   biased and mobilization-oriented approach is what distinguishes
   far-right media from mainstream media and guarantees them a loyal and
   dedicated supporter base.}},

Title = {{Natural Stings: Selling Distrust About Vaccines on Brazilian YouTube}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN COMMUNICATION}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{OCT 26}},
Abstract = {{In this study, we investigate misinformation and disinformation (M\&D)
   about vaccines using a case study approach to understand how M\&D about
   vaccines circulate on YouTube in Portuguese, and who are the channels
   creating and disseminating this kind of content. The World Health
   Organization considered vaccine hesitation as one of the greatest
   threats to global health in 2019. Researchers associated this hesitation
   to a strengthening of the anti-vaccination movements, suggesting that
   social media is currently the main spreader of this position. YouTube
   increasingly becomes a matter of concern, since its recommendation
   system is identified as a promoter of misinformation and extreme
   content. Despite YouTube's statements, M\&D about vaccines continue to
   be disseminated in videos in Portuguese, reaching a large audience. We
   found 52 videos containing M\&D about vaccines. The main M\&D were the
   claim of dangerous ingredients in vaccines, the defense of
   self-direction-freedom of choice, independent research-, the promotion
   of alternative health services, the myth that vaccines cause diseases,
   conspiracy theories, and the allegation of vaccine's severe collateral
   effects. We identified 39 brands advertising on 13 videos of our M\&D
   sample. Although the YouTube Partner Program is an important source of
   income, the channels use different economic strategies, such as the
   selling of courses, and therapies and the use of fundraising platforms.
   We also found that alternative health channels spread distrust about
   traditional institutions to promote themselves as trusted sources for
   the audience and thereby profit with alternative health services.}},

   Covid-19. Influence of misinformation in public and media}},
Journal = {{REVISTA LATINA DE COMUNICACION SOCIAL}},
Year = {{2020}},
Number = {{78}},
Pages = {{65-96}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: The information disorder generated by Covid-19 paints a
   strategic scenario for the dissemination of the fallacy and political
   propaganda. Social networks, in echo-chamber mode, reproduce the
   government's discourse of confusion and lie and favor a climate of
   destabilizing disinformation in democracies. In parallel, digital
   audiences are installed as prosumers of the political hoax on Twitter,
   and a tendency of the media to combat fake news is seen. Methodology:
   The main objective is to know which disinformation brands identify the
   leader's message, what role audiences play in the production and
   dissemination of the false, and what verification processes are carried
   out by fact-checking agencies (Pagella Politica, Maldito Bulo, Full
   Fact, and PolitiFact) and the media (La Repubblica, El Pais, The
   Guardian and The New York Times) in favor of the reliability of the
   public in a situation of maximum risk. On a sample composed of tweets
   published by the presidents of government (n = 272), news related to
   Covid-19 (n1 = 4,543), and hoaxes detected on Twitter (n1 = 200), we
   designed a methodology for quantitative-qualitative content analysis and
   critical analysis of political discourse. SPSS applied statistics
   software is used. Results, Discussion, and conclusions: The results
   reveal the prominence of a fallacious political language, which favors
   the production of hoaxes on the Internet and requires the effectiveness
   of the fact-checking system of international agencies and the media, to
   combat the false, always, and more if possible in moments of an
   unprecedented health pandemic.}},

Abstract = {{``Yesterday's was a totalitarian war, in which the dominant elements
   were quantity, mass and the power of the atomic bomb. Tomorrow's war
   will be globalitarian, in which, by virtue of the information bomb, the
   qualitative will be of greater importance than geophysical scale or
   population size.{''} (Virilio 2005: 144) Virilio'sThe Information Bomb
   presents a vision of future conflicts occurring as much on an
   informational and conceptual battlefield as a physical terrain. In a
   world where even the 24-hour news cycle of conventional broadcasting
   fails to keep up with the endlessly proliferating, instantly updated
   streams of data, and where the boundaries between sender and receiver
   are blurred to the point of non-existence, any concept of
   ``full-spectrum dominance{''} in the informational realm is doomed to
   failure. Conventional models of influence, based on one to many,
   top-down delivery will be rejected out of hand by audiences who display
   an ever-growing disillusion with and distrust of official channels of
   information. In this paper, I suggest that the present terrain offers a
   number of opportunities for developing strategies and tactics of
   information warfare which are based on the techniques already deployed
   by anti-establishment actors: detournement, satire, and the
   appropriation and subversion of pre-existing media artefacts. I will
   also argue that conflict in the ``fifth domain{''} should view the
   inherent complexity, diversity and apparent anarchy of the online realm
   as aids, rather than threats to the effective exercise of influence.
   Norbert Wiener wrote in 1954 that ``There is no Maginot Line of the
   brain{''}. This is both a salutary reminder that a fortress mentality is
   fatal in cybersecurity, and a call to arms against any system of thought
   which is not multidisciplinary. The final section of this paper will
   build on Wiener's idea, by arguing that we can learn from certain
   current trends in computer gaming (most notably what has been termed
   ``ludonarrative dissonance{''}) how to devise strategies of influence
   which rely, not on the presentation of a simplistic message or
   counter-narrative, but on the cultivation of a mindset which sows doubt,
   uncertainty in a receiver's mind, and an awareness that their world-view
   is not the only one possible. Truly successful information warfare must
   rely less on the information itself than on the construction of the
   mental frameworks through and within which that information is
   processed; this paper seeks to present a number of ways in which this
   framework may be reshaped.}},

Abstract = {{Traditional software security patches often have the unfortunate
   side-effect of quickly alerting attackers that their attempts to exploit
   patched vulnerabilities have failed. Attackers greatly benefit from this
   information; it expedites their search for unpatched vulnerabilities, it
   allows them to reserve their ultimate attack payloads for successful
   attacks, and it increases attacker confidence in stolen secrets or
   expected sabotage resulting from attacks.
   To overcome this disadvantage, a methodology is proposed for
   reformulating a broad class of security patches into honey-patches
   patches that offer equivalent security but that frustrate attackers'
   ability to determine whether their attacks have succeeded or failed.
   When an exploit attempt is detected, the honey-patch transparently and
   efficiently redirects the attacker to an unpatched decoy, where the
   attack is allowed to succeed. The decoy may host aggressive software
   monitors that collect important attack information, and deceptive files
   that disinform attackers. An implementation for three production-level
   web servers, including Apache HTTP, demonstrates that honey-patching can
   be realized for large-scale, performance-critical software applications
   with minimal overheads.}},

Abstract = {{Social media have been central in informing people about the COVID-19
   pandemic. They influence the ways in which information is perceived,
   communicated and shared online, especially with physical distancing
   measures in place. While these technologies have given people the
   opportunity to contribute to public discussions about COVID-19, the
   narratives disseminated on social media have also been characterised by
   uncertainty, disagreement, false and misleading advice. Global
   technology companies have responded to these concerns by introducing new
   content moderation policies based on the concept of harm to tackle the
   spread of misinformation and disinformation online. In this essay, we
   examine some of the key challenges in implementing these policies in
   real time and at scale, calling for more transparent and nuanced content
   moderation strategies to increase public trust and the quality of

Abstract = {{During the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, various officials flagged the
   critical threat of false information. In this study, we explore how
   three major social media platforms (Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube)
   responded to this ``infodemic{''} during early stages of the pandemic
   via emergent fact-checking policies and practices, and consider what
   this means for ensuring a well-informed public. We accomplish this
   through a thematic analysis of documents published by the three
   platforms that address fact-checking, particularly those that focus on
   COVID-19. In addition to examining what the platforms said they did, we
   also examined what the platforms actually did in practice via a
   retrospective case study drawing on secondary data about the viral
   conspiracy video, Plandemic. We demonstrate that the platforms focused
   their energies primarily on the visibility of COVID-19
   mis/disinformation on their sites via (often vaguely described) policies
   and practices rife with subjectivity. Moreover, the platforms
   communicated the expectation that users should ultimately be the ones to
   hash out what they believe is true. We argue that this approach does not
   necessarily serve the goal of ensuring a well-informed public, as has
   been the goal of fact-checking historically, and does little to address
   the underlying conditions and structures that permit the circulation and
   amplification of false information online.}},

Abstract = {{This paper discusses the use of Twitter as a news source, especially in
   data journalism. This practice uses public databases as sources for its
   investigations, but has now started to make use of less conventional
   sources, such as Twitter, which politicians now use as an official
   communication channel and thus avoid giving interviews to the press. In
   this study, we analyze news articles published over a period of a little
   less than two months by the data journalism team at Vortex Media. Our
   focus was on political coverage. Twitter may be classified as a
   reproductive or statistical documentary news sources, depending on the
   case. We argue that, by using this social networking site as a news
   source, data journalism could be able to provide new knowledge. Its
   limitations lie within the working order of the social network itself,
   which is highly mediated by algorithms and conditioned to spread
   disinformation.}},

   Despite the relevance and the diversity of approaches, few studies have

   fake news, presenting its significance and highlighting its different

   reveals that solutions to combat the phenomenon exist, but they focus

Abstract = {{The aim of the study is to research the effects of individual evaluation

   Results show that people in the individual evaluation condition assess
   completely fake news with greater veracity and completely truthful
   information with less veracity, compared to the fact-checking condition.
   This response is more pronounced in the most religious people and among
   those most affected by structural inequalities in Costa Rican society
   (e.g., lower educational level, living on the coasts and lower
   subjective income). Finally, both the individual evaluation of
   disinformation content and exposure to fact-checking reduce the

Abstract = {{Scholars and policymakers long believed that norms of global information
   openness and private-sector governance helped to sustain and promote
   liberalism. These norms are being increasingly contested within liberal
   democracies. In this article, we argue that a key source of debate over
   the Liberal International Information Order (LIIO), a sub-order of the
   Liberal International Order (LIO), is generated internally by
   ``self-undermining feedback effects,{''} that is, mechanisms through
   which institutional arrangements undermine their own political
   conditions of survival over time. Empirically, we demonstrate how global
   governance of the Internet, transnational disinformation campaigns, and
   domestic information governance interact to sow the seeds of this
   contention. In particular, illiberal states converted norms of openness
   into a vector of attack, unsettling political bargains in liberal states
   concerning the LIIO. More generally, we set out a broader research
   agenda to show how the international relations discipline might better
   understand institutional change as well as the informational aspects of
   the current crisis in the LIO.}},

Abstract = {{Wikipedia is a major source of information for many people. However,
   false information on Wikipedia raises concerns about its credibility.
   One way in which false information may be presented on Wikipedia is in
   the form of hoax articles, i.e., articles containing fabricated facts
   about nonexistent entities or events. In this paper we study false
   information on Wikipedia by focusing on the hoax articles that have been
   created throughout its history. We make several contributions. First, we
   assess the real-world impact of hoax articles by measuring how long they
   survive before being debunked, how many pageviews they receive, and how
   heavily they are referred to by documents on the Web. We find that,
   while most hoaxes are detected quickly and have little impact on
   Wikipedia, a small number of hoaxes survive long and are well cited
   across the Web. Second, we characterize the nature of successful hoaxes
   by comparing them to legitimate articles and to failed hoaxes that were
   discovered shortly after being created. We find characteristic
   differences in terms of article structure and content, embeddedness into
   the rest of Wikipedia, and features of the editor who created the hoax.
   Third, we successfully apply our findings to address a series of
   classification tasks, most notably to determine whether a given article
   is a hoax. And finally, we describe and evaluate a task involving humans
   distinguishing hoaxes from non-hoaxes. We find that humans are not good
   at solving this task and that our automated classifier outperforms them
   by a big margin.}},

Abstract = {{A new approach to teaching web source evaluation is necessary for an
   internet that is increasingly littered with sources of questionable
   merit and motivation. Initially pioneered by K-12 educational
   specialists, the journalistic model avoids the cognitive duality of the
   checklist and a reliance on opaque terms and concepts. Instead, it
   recommends students apply the six journalistic questions of what, who,
   where, when, why, and how when evaluating freely available web sources.
   This approach outlines an evaluative procedure that is open-ended,
   discursive, and analytic in nature as opposed to formulaic and
   binaristic. It also requires students to consider both the context of
   the information need and a source's potential use as central to its
   evaluation.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports some of the results obtained in a case study
   conducted in a Portuguese Public Higher Education Institution and whose
   aim was to identify the student's perceptions of fake news. Information
   was collected using an online questionnaire and a focus group. In this
   paper, we present some of the results gathered with the questionnaire
   covering several issues related to student's perceptions of fake news
   and online disinformation. The sample comprised 49 students who were
   attending the 2nd year of the bachelor's degree in Media and
   Communication, in 2018/2019. Among a wide range of results obtained, we
   found out that, for the most part, students trust the news and the
   information they get from television, printed media and radio.
   Participants' answers show that, on the other hand, messaging apps,
   social media and websites are less reliable sources of information. When
   they decide to share the news they feel worth sharing, most of the
   students experience a certain apprehension. They usually check the
   author of such news and whether or not the sources are mentioned, they
   confirm where the news were originally published and the date on which
   they were released and verify the way they were written.}},

Journal = {{PACIFIC JOURNALISM REVIEW}},

Volume = {{26}},

Pages = {{179-200}},
Abstract = {{Parallel with the global spread of the novel coronavirus pandemic, a
   dangerous `disinfodemic' has been infecting the flow of information
   world-wide. Communication and media outlets have faced a new challenge
   with not only being responsible for reportage and analysis of a
   fast-moving public health emergency the biggest this century, but forced
   to sift through the mass circulation of falsehoods that have spread as
   rapidly as the virus. Concerned about the risks for both health and
   public responses to disinformation, United Nations Secretary-General
   Antonio Guterres identified the `new enemy' as a `growing surge of
   disinformation'. The UN launched a COVID-19 Communications for
   Solidarity Initiative to rapidly inform people about facts and science
   and to `promote and inspire acts of humanity' globally. Also alarmed by
   the growing disinformation trend, the World Health Organisation warned
   that the `same enemy' also involved `an increase in stigma, hate speech
   and hate crimes' over the pandemic. Aotearoa New Zealand is one of the
   few countries in the world whose strategy of COVID elimination has been
   a sustained approach to `keep the virus out, find it and stamp it out'.
   Evoking a theme of `our team of five million' and national kindness,
   Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has led a remarkable campaign blending
   decisive action and transparency. As at October 25, the country has had
   only 22 deaths from the first wave of the pandemic and with a second
   wave cluster in August three further deaths and a combined total of 1935
   cases with 260 having been contained in quarantine or managed isolation
   at the border. In this context, this article critically examines a
   four-month Coronavirus Plus' initiative conducted by the Pacific Media
   Centre at a communication programme in one of the New Zealand's
   universities in response to the pandemic, deploying the Asia Pacific
   Report website, asiapacificreport.nz.}},

Abstract = {{In the current media context more and more voices warn about
   disinformation, fake news or false news and the impact that these have
   through social media on young people. It is important to know to what
   degree Journalism students detect and interact with this type of

   enable these professionals to detect and avoid the spread of
   misinformation pieces of news. It is based on a methodological
   triangulation. Quantitative data have been obtained through an online
   questionnaire administered to a sample of 200 students enrolled in the
   academic year (2019/2020) in the degrees of the area of Journalism. And
   through two focus groups with students of these degrees we have
   qualitatively approached the opinion of future journalists about fake
   news. Despite the fact that almost three out of every four students
   surveyed state that they know how to distinguish a false news from a
   true one and more than half consider that the teachers have provided
   them with tools to fight against misinformation, 97.6\% of students
   consider important to enhance media literacy in the university

Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The relationship between a subject's ideological persuasion with the
   belief and spread of fake news is the object of our study. Departing
   from a left- vs. right-wing framework, a questionnaire sought to
   position subjects on this political-ideological spectrum and demanded
   them to evaluate five pro-left and pro-right fake and real news,
   totaling 20 informational products. The results show the belief and
   dissemination of (fake) news are related to the political ideology of
   the participants, with right-wing subjects exhibiting a greater tendency
   to accept fake news, regardless of whether it is pro-left or pro-right
   fake news. These findings contradict the confirmation bias and may
   suggest that a greater influence of factors such as age, the level of
   digital news literacy and psychological aspects in the judgment of fake
   news are at play. Older and less educated respondents indicated they
   believed and would disseminate fake news at greater rates. Regardless of
   the ideology they favor, the Portuguese attributed higher credibility to
   the sample's real news, a fact that can be meaningful regarding the
   fight against disinformation in Portugal and elsewhere.}},

   Pandemic in Spain}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{15}},
Pages = {{5158-5185}},
Abstract = {{The informational practices of citizens, transformed by the digital
   sphere, pose new challenges such as misinformation and disinformation,
   and they also require a rethinking of the role of opinion leaders. We
   explored how, on Twitter, the credibility of COVID-19 news was
   influenced by the source of the news. We conducted a survey of a
   representative sample of the Spanish population (N = 2,041) who were
   asked to rate politician, expert, celebrity, media, and anonymous
   citizen tweets for credibility. The results show that the perceived
   credibility of tweets on COVID-19 by politicians and experts was
   negative and positive, respectively, when compared with tweets by the
   media, and also that celebrities and anonymous citizens had no impact on
   perceptions of credibility. We also found that news credibility was

Abstract = {{RT (formerly, Russia Today) is one of the most important organizations
   in the global political economy of disinformation. It is the most richly
   funded, well-staffed, formal organization in the world producing,
   disseminating, and marketing news in the service of the Kremlin. It is
   an agency accused of many things, but little is known about all the
   creative work involved in financing, governing, training, and motivating
   RT's activities. To understand more about the production of political
   news and information by RT, we investigate its organizational behavior
   through in-depth interviews of current and former staff. Our data show
   that RT is an opportunist channel that is used as an instrument of state
   defense policy to meddle in the politics of other states. The channel
   has been established in the shadows of the Soviet media system and its
   organizational behavior is characterized by Soviet-style controls.}},

   effectively engage with news, information and debates about important
   science and health issues. However, they have also become a fertile
   ground for various stakeholders to spread misinformation and

   dangerous public decisions. During the COVID-19 pandemic,
   antivaccination social media accounts were proliferating online,
   threatening to further escalate vaccine hesitancy. The pandemic
   signifies not only a global health crisis, it has also proven to be an
   infodemic, characterised by many conspiracy theories. Prior research
   indicates that belief in health-related conspiracies can harm efforts to
   curtail the spread of a virus. This article presents and examines
   preliminary research findings on COVID-19 vaccine related misinformation

Abstract = {{Any confrontation seeks the (partial) imposition of one party's will on
   an adversary. In recent years, digital technologies and data science
   have combined to create new ways of controlling the narrative and
   carrying out powerful information or disinformation campaigns that are
   part of a new type of warfare with digital characteristics. In
   particular, based on a literature review and the direct work of authors
   in different expert groups, this paper studies the use of either static
   or moving images (real, altered, or wholly artificially generated) as
   one of the most efficient means of altering perceptions and thereby
   narratives in the so-called cognitive domain. To this aim, this article
   collects in an orderly and exhaustive way the most recent military and
   intelligence doctrine related to such ``influence operations,{''} from a
   dual technological-sociological perspective. Based on this, the paper
   determines the differences between traditional disinformation techniques
   and those incorporating digital and artificial intelligence technologies
   in the form of images and video. The paper proposes a new double-entry
   taxonomy that can display the degree of image faking and the objective
   of disinformation. This helps to identify and prioritize the most
   relevant cases and thus adopt the most appropriate countermeasures.
   These are also examined in detail, leading to the conclusion that only a
   combination of transparency, consumer education, technology, and
   regulation can counteract the increasing use of images and video with
   false content.}},

Year = {{2021}},

Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{201-210}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Since COVID-19 emerged, a plethora of misinformation has undermined the
   public's ability to identify reliable sources of accurate information.
   To identify the range of methods governments used to address COVID-19
   misinformation, we conducted a content analysis of international media
   and evaluated government actions in light of international law, which
   protects freedom of expression and calls on governments to guarantee
   this fundamental right even during a pandemic or other emergency. We
   identified five categories of government activities: (1) disseminating
   and increasing access to accurate information; (2) restricting access to
   accurate information; (3) disseminating disinformation, false
   information, and misinformation; (4) addressing commercial fraud; and
   (5) criminalizing expression. The goal of addressing COVID-19
   misinformation is best served by protecting expression, disseminating
   factual information, ensuring strong protections for whistleblowers, and
   supporting an independent media environment. Conversely, governments
   undermine public health when they create a state of uncertainty and
   violate human rights.}},

Abstract = {{The presence of disinformation and fake news on the Internet and
   especially social media has become a major concern. Prime examples of
   such fake news surged in the 2016 U.S. presidential election cycle and
   the COVID-19 pandemic. We quantify sentiment differences between true
   and fake news on social media using a diverse body of datasets from the
   literature that contains about 100K previously labeled true and fake
   news. We also experiment with a variety of sentiment analysis tools. We
   model the association between sentiment and veracity as conditional
   probability and also leverage statistical hypothesis testing to uncover
   the relationship between sentiment and veracity. With a significance
   level of 99.999\%, we observe a statistically significant relationship
   between negative sentiment and fake news and between positive sentiment
   and true news. The degree of association, as measured by Goodman and
   Kruskal's gamma, ranges between .037 to .475. Finally, we make our data
   and code publicly available to support reproducibility. Our results
   assist in the development of automatic fake news detectors.}},

   defense of the democratic system and the harmful effects it produces on
   the rights of citizens. It is not a new problem, but now, networks are
   used to spread hoaxes that respond to interests of different nature, but
   always with the aim of impacting trust in institutions and, ultimately,
   in the established social order. The analysis of our regulatory
   framework offers us enough instruments to fight against these disorders,
   discarding the temptation to defend a restrictive regulation of online
   information freedoms or a more intense intervention on the Internet.
   Public policies for strengthening democracy can be an adequate
   instrument, influencing public-private collaboration to defend our
   democratic system against the innumerable challenges and threats that
   threaten us.}},

Abstract = {{The use of social networks and their increasingly sophisticated and
   effective communication and sharing tools has gained - in a relatively
   short time - an immense space in the field of political-electoral
   clashes, either as a direct (official) way of electoral advertising or
   in an indirect way. In this context, as was acutely seen in the last US
   and Brazilian presidential elections, the use of so-called ``fake
   news{''} (but also, among others, hate speech), also dominated the
   scenario in the most differentiated media, with emphasis, again, on the
   Internet social networks environment. In the meantime, much research has
   been done and written about these phenomena, whether from the
   perspective of political science, or from the point of view of
   sociology, psychology, anthropology, neurosciences, cultural theory,
   among others. In the case of the Law, more specifically from the point
   of view of Constitutional Law, one of the central problems with which
   the legal academy, but also the state bodies (namely the Legislative,
   Executive and Judiciary powers), have been dealing is to verify to what
   extend the use of disinformation techniques in general and the
   management of fake news, in particular, has influenced the full
   functioning of democracy and its institutions, as is the case with
   elections and the respective process, key to a representative and
   partisan democracy. Thus, this article intends to examine, discuss and
   evaluate whether - and to what extent - the use of false, misleading,
   out-of-context, inaccurate news, etc., what has generally been called
   fake news, is protected by the freedoms of expression and information
   and, if so, what limits may legitimately be imposed at times of
   elections, so as not to configure a disproportionate impact on the
   democratic principle and the effective functioning of the respective
   institutions. Furthermore, it is intended to confirm the thesis, already
   known, not only of the terminological imprecision, but also of the
   blatant reductionism of the fake news figure to account for the
   complexity and scope of the phenomenon. Besides this - and that is the
   main goal - what is being sought is to examine and evaluate, in light of
   the case of Brazil and the respective legal-constitutional framework,
   using the example of electoral propaganda and its regulation, how the
   use of disinformation and fake news has been dealt, what are the
   outstanding challenges and what are the possibilities of satisfactorily
   addressing the problem while preserving both freedom of expression and
   the functioning of democratic institutions.}},

Abstract = {{The paper offers some thoughts prompted by the research paper published
   by Peter Lor, Bradley Wiles, and Johannes Britz, ``Re-Thinking
   Information Ethics: Truth, Conspiracy Theories, and Librarians in the
   COVID-19 Era,{''} in LIBRI, March 2021. It highlights two significant
   contributions, an analysis of the misinformation in the COVID-19
   pandemic and the notion of alethic rights, the right of truth of patrons
   based on the work of D'Agostini. This reflection then situates the
   COVID-19 misinformation campaign within the broader disinformation
   ecology within which it exists. While it agrees that alethic rights are
   an important ethical framework, it wonders whether it practically
   advances work beyond that libraries and librarians are already doing,
   e.g., in collection decisions, approaches to reference questions, or
   library programming. It looks at the debate between John Swan and Noel
   Peattie on the inclusion of books representing outright lies in the
   collection (e.g., Holocaust denial). It then contrasts a right to
   information and authorities propagating and validating that information
   with a right to misinformation and authorities for propagating and
   validating that misinformation that exists within disinformation
   ecologies. The problem of truth, its authorities and its context appears
   to be more complicated than an appeal to alethic truths: for example,
   liberals and conservatives differ on the meaning of a rational consensus
   on contentious political matters, such as climate change. Given the dire
   consequences of misinformation on democracies and public health, an
   appeal to professional neutrality is woefully inadequate. There must be
   proactive resistance, if not outright repudiation.}},

Title = {{Reverse-engineering political protest: the Russian Internet Research
   Agency in the Heart of Texas}},
Journal = {{INFORMATION COMMUNICATION \& SOCIETY}},
Abstract = {{In the aftermath of the 2016 US presidential election, the public slowly
   began to grapple with the extent of Russian disinformation campaigns by
   the Internet Research Agency (IRA), elements of which were carried out
   on Facebook. Campaigns targeted people in the United States in many
   ways, including by publishing event pages on Facebook that were at times
   piggybacking on existing events, stoking fear, anger and other emotions
   already on the rise in an increasingly tribal political climate. In the
   summer before the election, two particular Facebook pages - `Heart of
   Texas' and the `United Muslims of America,' published events advertising
   protests in front of the Islamic Da'wah Center, a mosque and religious
   center in downtown Houston. Our study reverse-engineers the IRA-inspired
   `Heart of Texas' protests on 21 May 2016, using qualitative in-depth
   interviews with 14 individuals connected to these events - including
   counterprotest participants and local organizers, journalists who
   covered the protest, as well as representatives of local organizations.
   Results shed light on the role that news media played in protest
   coverage, the dynamics at the protest, issues around vetting information
   and the serendipity around how protests emerge and get organized on and
   off social media. This research documents and critically assesses the
   on-the-ground transactions such propaganda foments and offers insights
   into the role of social media in local protests.}},

Abstract = {{We introduce a special issue that collects eight articles, comprising
   research from twenty-three countries and four continents on the sources,
   impact on citizens, and possible remedies to various digital threats to
   democracy, ranging from disinformation to hate speech to state
   interference with online freedoms. We set these contributions against
   the backdrop of a profound change in how scholars think about the
   implications of digital media for democracy. From the utopianism that
   prevailed from the 1990s until the early 2010s, the post-2016 reckoning
   has led to a change in the kinds of questions scholars ask, with the
   focus gradually shifting to investigations of the threats, rather than
   the benefits, of the Internet. The eight contributions presented in this
   special issue employ a variety of disciplinary approaches and methods,
   often comparing different countries, to address some of the most
   pressing questions on how the Internet can hinder the feasibility and
   well-functioning of democracy around the world. We conclude by setting
   out three challenges for future research on digital media and politics:
   a growing but still partial understanding of the extent and impact of
   the main digital threats to democracy; the risk that the dominant
   approaches become overly pessimistic, or founded on weak normative
   grounds; and the risk that research overemphasizes direct and short-term
   implications of digital threats on individuals and specific groups at
   the expense of indirect and medium-term effects on collective norms and
   expectations of behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Dissemination of misleading drug information through social media can be
   detrimental to the health of the public. This study, carried out in
   Bahrain, evaluated the truthfulness of 22 social media claims about
   drugs (72.7\%), dietary supplements (22.7\%), and toxic bisphenol-A
   (4.5\%). They circulated on WhatsApp platform, as case studies. We
   categorized claims as objectively true, false, or potentially
   misleading. The content analysis revealed that ``potentially
   misleading{''} claims were the most frequent messages (59.1\%). They
   tend to exaggerate the efficacy or safety without sufficient evidence to
   substantiate claims. False claims (27.3\%) were likely due to unfair
   competition or deception. Overall, 13.6\% of the messages were
   objectively true claims that could withstand regulatory scrutiny.
   Majority of the drug-related messages on social media were potentially
   misleading or false claims that lacked credible evidence to support
   them. In the public interest, regulatory authorities should monitor such
   information disseminated via social media platforms.}},

Pages = {{199-209}},
Abstract = {{Social Networking has dominated the whole world by providing a platform
   of information dissemination. Usually people share information without
   knowing its truthfulness. Nowadays Social Networks are used for gaining
   influence in many fields like in elections, advertisements etc. It is
   not surprising that social media has become a weapon for manipulating
   sentiments by spreading disinformation. Propaganda is one of the
   systematic and deliberate attempts used for influencing people for the
   political, religious gains. In this research paper, efforts were made to
   classify Propagandist text from Non-Propagandist text using supervised
   machine learning algorithms. Data was collected from the news sources
   from July 2018-August 2018. After annotating the text, feature
   engineering is performed using techniques like term frequency/inverse
   document frequency (TF/IDF) and Bag of words (BOW). The relevant
   features are supplied to support vector machine (SVM) and Multinomial
   Naive Bayesian (MNB) classifiers. The fine tuning of SVM is being done
   by taking kernel Linear, Poly and RBF. SVM showed better results than
   MNB by having precision of 70\%, recall of 76.5\%, F1 Score of 69.5\%
   and overall Accuracy of 69.2\%.}},

Title = {{Forensic conflict studies: Making sense of war in the social media age}},
Journal = {{MEDIA WAR AND CONFLICT}},
Abstract = {{Online media is a blessing and a curse for academic research on war. On
   the one hand, the internet provides unprecedented access to information
   from conflict zones. On the other hand, the prevalence of disinformation
   can make it difficult to use this information in a transparent way. This
   article proposes digital forensic process tracing as a methodological
   innovation to tackle this challenge and make case study research on the
   causes of war fit for the social media age. It argues that two important
   features of process-tracing methodology - source criticism and Bayesian
   updating - are well developed in theory but are rarely applied to the
   study of armed conflict. Digital forensic process tracing applies these
   features to online media sources by drawing on the journalistic practice
   of open source intelligence (OSINT) analysis. This article uses the case
   of the war in eastern Ukraine's Donbas region to illustrate the
   usefulness of the proposed methodology.}},

Title = {{A review of political advertising online during the 2019 European
   Elections and establishing future regulatory requirements in Ireland}},
Journal = {{IRISH POLITICAL STUDIES}},
Abstract = {{Ahead of the 2019 European Parliament elections, the lack of regulation
   addressing online political advertising with the potential to undermine
   the integrity of the electoral process was a significant concern. Within
   Ireland, the Standards in Public Office Commission regulates `ethics,
   electoral, state finance and lobbying legislation', however, there are
   few requirements made of political parties to disclose their funding of
   online political advertising. As a wider EU issue, the European
   Commission sought to address this lack of oversight by engaging with
   social media platforms to agree a voluntary Code of Practice on
   Disinformation. Signatories to this, including Facebook, Google and
   Twitter, committed to `ensuring transparent, fair and trustworthy online
   campaign activities ahead of the European elections in spring 2019'
   (Kirk, N., Culloty, E., Casey, E., Teeling, L., Park, K., Kearns, C.
   Suiter, J. (2019). ElectCheck2019: A report on political advertising
   online during the 2019 European elections. Institute for Future Media
   and Journalism. https://doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.18135.01449). The report
   here summarises the data and key findings from monitoring the levels of
   transparency in the political advert libraries relating to Ireland over
   the European Election campaign from April 18th to May 24th, 2019. The
   report finds that, although platforms proactively engaged with their
   commitments under the EU Code, inconsistencies in the companies'
   approach to this result in a lack of transparency and comprehensive
   understanding of political and issue-based advertising online in such
   election campaigns.}},

   in this content. This article analyzes the structure and functioning of
   fact-checking organizations in the context of preventing propagation of
   fake news and improving digital literacy. The research is based on
   content analysis of verification activities of the fact-checking
   organization Teyit.org , which is a member of international
   Fact-Checking Network in Turkey, between January 1 and June 31, 2018. By
   conducting in-depth interviews with the verification team, propagation

Abstract = {{Webometrics is defined as ``the study of the quantitative aspects of the
   construction and use of information resources, structures and
   technologies on the web drawing on bibliometric and informetric
   approaches{''} (Bjorneborn \& Ingwerson 2004); and ``the study of
   web-based content with primarily quantitative methods for social science
   research goals{''} (Thelwall 2009). Hit Count Estimates (HCEs) are a
   webometric provided by search engines giving an approximate number of
   the relevant pages indexed by the search engine. HCEs are not very
   reliable, but they have been observed to be up to 78\% reliable on
   Google and it is the recommended platform for HCE-based research (Uyar
   2009). Webometrics may have promise in the fight against online
   disinformation and influence campaigns as evidenced by tools like
   Hamilton 68; or in the application of Google Trends and similar tools to
   highlight the possible effects of ``information attacks{''} (Hotchkiss
   2017). The current investigation seeks to apply HCEs as a webometric
   which may supplement existing findings in disinformation research. HCEs
   were collected over a period of 21 days for 38 ``Western{''} and Russian
   news sites and 38 `Top Level Domains' (TLDs) in order to create averages
   which would account for observed daily variability in HCEs. HCE results
   were collected for the total number of pages on the news site or TLD,
   the number of times the search term ``Nostradamus{''} (or regional
   translation) appeared on pages on the news site or TLD; and the number
   of times ``Nostradamus{''} (or regional translation) appeared in the
   page title on news sites. These data points were used to create various
   simple ratios and rankings. In addition, the qualitative aspects of the
   news sites with Nostradamus in page titles were analysed to determine if
   a site promoted belief in the supernatural powers of Nostradamus.
   Findings suggest Russia is an outlier among tested news sites and TLDs,
   and it promotes Nostradamus as a genuine prophet (especially to
   Spanish-language audiences via RT.com). Ultimately however, the
   sometimes apparently chaotic and non-contextual nature of HCEs means
   they are probably only good for supplemental findings, at best, and
   should be accompanied by a qualitative analysis if possible.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Vaccination is an essential tool in the prevention of
   highly contagious diseases. Currently, this procedure is becoming less
   widely used, due to various economic and social factors, among others,
   which have encouraged the reappearance of pathologies that were
   virtually disappeared. Objectives: To define the immune status of the
   health workers of the Hospital de Poniente and monitoring the
   effectiveness of vaccines administered by the Prevention Service on
   non-immunized health personnel. Methodology: A descriptive study
   evaluating by serology the immunity against measles, rubella, mumps,
   varicella and hepatitis B prior to and after the administration of
   vaccines to health personnel (n = 923). Results: A high percentage of
   the health worker population with protective antibodies against the
   microorganisms in the study was observed, either due to a correct
   vaccination schedule in childhood or due to subsequent vaccination by
   the Prevention Service (high rate of seroconversion). Conclusion: The
   study re-emphasizes the importance of vaccination as a preventive
   measure against the diseases analysed, justifying the need to launch
   information campaigns to strengthen their use.}},

Abstract = {{The nature of reality has been a central concern of philosophy and the
   social sciences, but since the proliferation of social media,
   psychological operations have taken on greater visibility and
   significance in political action. `Fake news' and micro-targeted and
   deceptive advertising in elections and votes has brought the tenuous
   character of political reality to the fore. The affordances of the
   Internet, World Wide Web and social media have enabled users to be
   mobilised to varying degrees of awareness for propaganda and
   disinformation campaigns both as producers and spreaders of content and
   as generators of data for profiling and targeting. This article will
   argue that social media platforms and the broader political economy of
   the Internet create the possibilities for online interactions and
   targeting which enable form of political intervention focused on the
   destabilisation of perceptions of reality and recruit users in the
   construction of new politically useful realities.}},

   found Facebook was used to spread hate and facilitate the persecution of
   the Rohingya. But we know little about how people in Myanmar actually
   use Facebook, how they acquire and evaluate the information they find on
   the platform and whether they see disinformation or extreme speech.
   Furthermore, we lack information about the sentiments that Facebook
   users and non-users express about the Rohingya and how they view
   Facebook's role in inter-ethnic conflict. We use interviews to address
   these questions. We find that people in Myanmar use Facebook for a
   variety of reasons, that they look at international and domestic
   sources, and encounter many different kinds of information-including
   extreme speech-on the platform. Most people also told us that they

Abstract = {{Scholars have characterized the EU as a normative power whose greatest
   asset is to be able to shape conceptions of what is normal' in
   international affairs. Scholars have argued that a normative power has
   to meet certain discursive standards; representing others in a
   non-antagonistic, humble way. We question whether the EU can live up to
   this ideal when defending itself against Russian strategic
   communication. The empirical enquiry establishes that while the EU High
   Commissioner communicates in line with the stipulated standards, the
   newly established East Stratcom Taskforce and its publication
   Disinformation Digest' diverges from this ideal. The establishment of
   the Taskforce has led to the EU losing reflexivity and normative power.
   The article concludes that while Diez' and Manners' standards are
   utopian in the contemporary communicative climate, they remain useful as
   guiding rules that can help normative powers watch their language' and
   avoid doing unnecessary harm.}},

Journal = {{MEDIA AND COMMUNICATION}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{229-238}},
Abstract = {{In the current media ecosystem, in which the traditional media coexists
   with new players who are able to produce information and spread it
   widely, there is growing concern about the increasing prominence of fake
   news. Despite some significant efforts to determine the effects of
   misinformation, the results are so far inconclusive. Previous research
   has sought to analyze how the public perceive the effects of
   disinformation. This article is set in this context, and its main
   objective is to investigate users' perception of fake news, as well as
   identify the criteria on which their recognition strategies are based.
   The research pays particular attention to determining whether there are
   gender differences in the concern about the effects of fake news, the
   degree of difficulty in detecting fake news and the most common topics
   it covers. The results are based on the analysis of a representative
   survey of the Spanish population (N = 1,001) where participants were
   asked about their relationship with fake news and their competence in
   determining the veracity of the information, and their ability to
   identify false content were assessed. The findings show that men and
   women's perception of difficulty in identifying fake news is similar,
   while women are more concerned than men about the pernicious effects of
   misinformation on society. Gender differences are also found in the
   topics of the false information received. A greater proportion of men
   receive false news on political issues, while women tend to more
   frequently receive fake news about celebrities.}},

Abstract = {{Digital diplomacy has become a major topic of international
   interdisciplinary analysis. Aimed at making an African contribution to
   knowledge, this article charts the emergence of digital diplomacy and
   presents evidence of unfolding practices and discussions in the African
   digital diplomacy sphere. The empirical segment of the article draws on
   data from 21 virtual sessions on African digital diplomacy, convened
   between July and August 2020 and involving over 50 African diplomats.
   Based on open-source software as well as qualitative analysis, the study
   results show that the risks of digital diplomacy, particularly
   disinformation and misinformation, are main concerns for modern
   diplomats. The study offers suggestions for the enhancement of digital
   diplomacy practices and scholarship, particularly for African
   governments and civil society, including additional primary research on
   approaches and uses of digital tools, increased collaboration between
   academics and practitioners, and the embedding of digital diplomacy in
   the foreign policy strategies of African states.}},

Title = {{Deepfakes and documentary practice in an age of misinformation}},
Journal = {{CONTINUUM-JOURNAL OF MEDIA \& CULTURAL STUDIES}},
Abstract = {{The emergence of deepfakes is the latest form to prompt anxieties over
   the wider implications of misinformation. This chapter explores
   possibilities for how these technologies extend the repertoire of
   modalities available for documentary makers. While these `synthetic
   media' offer a disruption of the documentary genre, they are also a
   continuation of long-standing trends within software culture and also
   clearly augment practices which are deeply embedded within the
   documentary genre. This discussion draws upon Wardle and Derakhshan's
   `misinformation' and `disinformation' framework to highlight the
   increasing complexity of documentary's forms and the challenges they
   pose to audiences. The limited experiments in integrating synthetic
   media into documentary media in a productive way suggest especially the
   possibilities for using these to develop more openly reflexive content.
   The proliferation of synthetic media forms prompt a wider need within
   documentary practitioners for critical data practices, software
   literacy, and ethical practices embedded within a broader understanding
   of automated, networked and entangled media systems. And they challenge
   documentary designers to strategise the nature of their content, and
   engage more directly with their audiences on questions around evidence,
   trust, authenticity and the nature of documentary media within an era of
   misinformation.}},

Abstract = {{The rise of `information disorder' that undermines Western political
   principles has become one of the key political concerns in today's
   Europe and United States and led to searching for new solutions to the
   problem of how to fight the spread of mis- and dis-information. The
   challenges of information disorder, however, are increasingly perceived
   as a part of the information war - which involves the intentional
   Russian propaganda using new media. Yet who gets to help our societies
   build resilience against the information war? This research looks at how
   this novel problematization of security affects the politics of security
   expertise. Or, who gains power in this `battle for truth'? Building on
   sociological approaches in security studies, this paper focuses on the
   Czech Republic as a country that has become very active in the fight
   against disinformation and analyses the network of actors recognized as
   providing security expertise on information warfare. Based on social
   network analysis, the research maps the structure of social relations
   among actors recognized as experts and points out the empowerment of
   think tanks and journalists, who are able to build social capital,
   mobilize their knowledge of Russian politics and the new media
   environment, and design new practices to make the society resilient
   towards information warfare.}},

   Methodology: 166 hoaxes reported by the organization Maldita.es to the
   collaborative verification platform LatamChequea from February 14 to
   April 15, 2020 have been analyzed. Results: Among the main results, we
   draw attention to the high presence of misinformation around infections
   and preventive measures. Conclusions: Misinformation and disinformation
   increases as the pandemic sets in and a series of containment measures
   are taken, we hightlight the viralization of hoaxes through social

Abstract = {{The review discusses a book written by Nic Cheeseman and Brian Klaas
   ``How to Rig an Election{''} (New Haven, London: Yale University Press,
   2019). Based on field research, conducted by authors themselves in
   countries across sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East and Southeast Asia,
   and secondary sources they demonstrate the variety of manipulative tools
   at the disposal of authoritarian incumbents. Besides describing the
   authoritarian toolbox, authors pay attention to the ways of
   strengthening electoral integrity both in authoritarian and democratic
   regimes. ``How to Rig an Election{''} neither puts forward nor tests
   empirically any research hypotheses. At the same time, the book proposes
   some new research questions for the further studying. What factors
   influence the incumbents' choice of given manipulative tools during an
   election? Whether disinformation in social media and fake news affect
   voters' electoral behavior? The book, aimed primarily at a wide
   audience, will be useful to anyone interested in authoritarian
   elections, the politics of electoral malpractice and electoral
   integrity. For those who are deeply familiar with the literature on
   comparative authoritarianism, the content of the book will be
   uninformative.}},

Title = {{The Atomic Spy Who Never Was: ``Perseus{''} and KGB/SVR Atomic Espionage
   Disinformation}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENCE AND COUNTERINTELLIGENCE}},
Abstract = {{In the late 1980s and early 1990s the KGB and its successor SVR began a
   campaign to claim a large share of credit for the USSR's development of
   an atomic bomb. Memoirs by KGB officers celebrated their service's
   success in penetrating the American ``Manhattan{''} project. As part of
   this campaign, in 1991, Vladimir Chikov, a serving KGB (later SVR)
   officer, published an article in Russian and English, followed by a
   full-length book in French (1996), German (1996), and Russian (1997) on
   the exploits of an atomic superspy code named ``Perseus,{''} said to
   still be alive and unknown to American security. ``Perseus{''} was
   described as a senior physicist who was part of the Manhattan project
   from its origins, working first at the Chicago ``Med{''} lab with Enrico
   Fermi and later at Los Alamos with Robert Oppenheimer. Veteran KGB
   officer Anatoly Yatskov, who had supervised several spies in the
   Manhattan project, added his endorsement of the ``Perseus{''} story. For
   years, amateur and professional researchers used the clues in Chikov's
   writings to search for the identity of ``Perseus,{''} but no strong
   candidate emerged. With the opening of the Venona decryptions in 1995,
   most professional historians became convinced that ``Perseus{''} was a
   KGB/SVR fiction, but ``Perseus{''} lingers still with the wider public
   as a yet unidentified Soviet atomic spy. This article points to the
   internal contradictions and impossible assertions in Chikov's
   ``Perseus{''} story, as well as how Venona shows that Chikov took
   elements of the story of a real Soviet spy, Theodor Hall, to construct
   the ``Perseus{''} myth. Hall was a junior scientist without an advanced
   degree who worked at Los Alamos in 1944 and 1945 (never at Chicago), but
   Chikov moved Hall's story back to 1942 and elevated him from a junior
   figure to a senior scientist and associate of Fermi and Oppenheimer who,
   in Chikov's words, gave Stalin ``the Manhattan project on a serving
   plate.{''} Further, Chikov gave ``Perseus{''} numerous attributes that
   precluded the still living Hall from ever being a candidate for the
   atomic spy ``Perseus.{''}}},

Volume = {{29}},

Abstract = {{Among the burgeoning discussions on the argumentative styles of
   conspiracy theories and the related cognitive processes of their
   audiences, research thus far is limited in regard to developing methods
   and strategies that could effectively debunk conspiracy theories and
   reduce the harmful influences of conspiracist media exposure. The
   present study critically evaluates the effectiveness of five approaches
   to reducing conspiratorial belief, through experiments (N=607) conducted
   on Amazon Mechanical Turk. Our results demonstrate that the
   content-based methods of counter conspiracy theory can partly mitigate
   conspiratorial belief. Specifically, the science- and fact-focused
   corrections were able to effectively mitigate conspiracy beliefs,
   whereas media literacy and inoculation strategies did not produce
   significant change. More crucially, our findings illustrate that both
   audience-focused methods, which involve decoding the myth of conspiracy
   theory and re-imagining intergroup relationships, were effective in
   reducing the cognitive acceptance of conspiracy theory. Building on
   these insights, this study contributes to a systematic examination of
   different epistemic means to influence (or not) conspiracy beliefs -an
   urgent task in the face of the infodemic threat apparent both during and
   after the COVID-19 pandemic.}},

Abstract = {{Vaccine hesitancy (delay in obtaining a vaccine, despite availability)
   represents a significant hurdle to managing the COVID-19 pandemic.
   Vaccine hesitancy is in part related to the prevalence of anti-vaccine
   misinformation and disinformation, which are spread through social media
   and user-generated content platforms. This study uses qualitative coding
   methodology to identify salient narratives and rhetorical styles common
   to anti-vaccine and COVID-denialist media. It organizes these narratives
   and rhetorics according to theme, imagined antagonist, and frequency.
   Most frequent were narratives centered on ``corrupt elites{''} and
   rhetorics appealing to the vulnerability of children. The identification
   of these narratives and rhetorics may assist in developing effective
   public health messaging campaigns, since narrative and emotion have
   demonstrated persuasive effectiveness in other public health
   communication settings.}},

Abstract = {{As a global epidemic of the social media age, COVID-19 has also resulted
   in an `infodemic', which means the uncontrolled spreading of false
   information about the health situation. Spreading of health information
   is a special intersection point of the freedom of speech, freedom of
   science, and the fundamental right to life and health. The paper
   analyses the European and Hungarian legal framework for health
   communication from multiple perspectives. Regulatory challenges and
   solutions differ for professional health communication, commercial
   communication and health communication by laypeople. As with all forms
   of misinformation, private regulations of platform operators have a
   significant regulatory role to play in relation to health
   disinformation. As a result of the analysis, the paper provides a
   detailed regulatory map that also covers private regulation solutions
   and explores the factors that need to be considered when designing a
   comprehensive future regulation.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION}},

Abstract = {{Although a growing body of literature has provided important insight
   into the conceptualization and consequences of mis- and disinformation,
   we know little about the construction of communicative (un)truthfulness
   online. Because (partisan) attributions of dishonesty and inaccuracy may
   influence citizens' political opinions, and because accusations of fake
   news can be used to delegitimize political opponents and the media, it
   is important to understand how politicians and citizens construct
   different versions of (un)truthfulness. We specifically look at how
   (radical) right-wing populist politicians and citizens attribute
   antimedia and anti-elite sentiments in digital media settings. Against
   this backdrop, this article relies on two qualitative content analyses
   in the United States and The Netherlands to understand how discourses
   around (1) the epistemic status of facts and (2) inaccurate and (3)
   dishonest information are constructed by (radical) right-wing populists
   and citizens participating in Facebook discussions. The results provide
   important insights into the resonance of the expression of
   (un)truthfulness with perceptual screens and hostile media perceptions.}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Henry VII is generally seen as the initiator of a vigorous campaign of
   Tudor propaganda about the events which led to his accession. This
   article argues that his policy was rather one of selective obfuscation,
   even deliberate concealment. As late as 1512 the conscientious compiler
   of the London Great Chronicle could provide only a confused account of
   Richard III's reign, and very little on Henry's own family background or
   on his time in exile. Only slightly less vague were the poems and
   declamations produced in Henry's court, and these had little circulation
   in the country at large. Even the alleged confession to the murder of
   the princes in the Tower by Tyrell in 1502 was not publicized. A
   reasonably rounded account of Richard's reign and of Henry's own life
   before Bosworth was only established with the investigations by Polydore
   Vergil and Thomas More between 1512 and 1518; and even then their
   diffusion had to await the first printing of Vergil in 1534 and
   Grafton's plagiarizing of both authors in 1543. Until then silence was
   evidently thought to be the best policy. Historians too readily make the
   working assumption that the people they study had access to an ordered
   view of the recent past without establishing how far this was so in a
   particular case.}},

Abstract = {{Disinformation on social media-commonly called ``fake news{''}-has
   become a major concern around the world, and many fact-checking
   initiatives have been launched to mitigate the problem. The way
   fact-checking results are presented to social media users is important
   because if the presentation format is not persuasive, then fact-checking
   may not be effective. For instance, Facebook tested the idea of flagging
   dubious articles in 2017 but concluded that it was ineffective and
   subsequently removed the feature. We conducted three experiments with
   social media users to investigate two different approaches to
   implementing a fake news flag-one designed to have its primary effect
   when processed by automatic cognition (System 1) and the other designed
   to have its primary effect when processed by deliberate cognition
   (System 2). We found that both interventions were effective, and an
   intervention that combined both approaches was about twice as effective.
   We also found that awareness training on the meaning of the flags
   increased the effectiveness of the System 2 intervention but not the
   System 1 intervention, exactly as theory predicts. Believability, in
   turn, influenced the extent to which users would engage with the article
   (e.g., read, like, comment, and share). Our results suggest that both
   theoretical routes can be used-separately or together-in the
   presentation of fact-checking results in order to reduce the influence
   of fake news on the users.}},

Abstract = {{In most African countries, ``fake news,{''} politically motivated
   disinformation, and misinformation in the media were common occurrences
   before these became a preoccupation in the Global North. However, with a
   fast-growing population of mobile users, and the popularization of apps
   such as WhatsApp, misinformation has become much more pervasive across
   the continent. Researchers have shown that perceived exposure to false
   information is high in some African countries, and yet citizens often
   share made-up news intentionally. This article explores the motivations
   and contributing factors for sharing misinformation in six sub-Saharan
   African countries. Our analysis of 12 focus groups with university
   students reveals two common motivations: civic duty and fun. The sharing
   of political (dis)information was uneven, but common among students with
   high levels of self-reported political engagement. We also present an
   array of cues used to determine credibility, which often determines the
   shareability of information. Cross-national differences are also
   discussed.}},

   concerns into online information, as has occurred in search and social
   media content. Consumers' ratings and reviews do promotional work for
   brands-not just for products but the platforms that host reviews-that
   money can't always buy. Gains in power by consumers are quickly met with
   new strategies of control by companies who depend on reviews for
   reputational capital. Focusing on ecommerce giant Amazon, this article
   examines the complexities of online reviews, where individual efforts to
   provide product feedback and help others make choices become transformed
   into an information commodity and promotional vehicle. It acknowledges
   the ambiguous nature of reviews due to the rise of industries and
   business practices that influence or fake reviews as a promotional
   strategy. In response are yet other business practices and platform
   policies aiming to provide better information to consumers, protect the
   image of platforms that host reviews, and punish `bad actors' in
   competitive markets. The complexity in the production, regulation, and
   manipulation of product ratings and reviews illustrates how the high
   stakes of attention in digital spaces create fertile ground for
   disinformation, which only emphasizes to users that they inhabit a
   `post-truth' reality online.}},

Abstract = {{The modus operandi of far-right political groups is crafted through
   strategic and systematic relationships between symbolic and material
   forms of violence. This article considers the discursive strategies
   currently deployed by rising far-right movements around the globe by
   examining the weaponization of language - the rapid acceleration of
   signifying practices that lay the essential cornerstones of material
   violence. Authoritarian governments weaponize language to amplify
   resentments, target scapegoats, and to legitimize injustice. The article
   provides an overview of the discursive strategies being used to expand
   and consolidate far-right politics. It focuses on four interlocking
   components of weaponized language: propaganda, disinformation,
   censorship, and mundane discourse. The article concludes by considering
   the unique intellectual space sociological studies of language offer for
   addressing the communicative and social chaos created by right-wing
   discursive tactics.}},

Title = {{FakeSafe: Human Level Steganography Techniques by Disinformation Mapping
   Using Cycle-Consistent Adversarial Network}},
Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{9}},
Pages = {{159364-159370}},
Abstract = {{Steganography is the task of concealing a message within an overt medium
   such that the presence of the hidden message is barely detectable.
   Recently, myriads of works have introduced the inchoate techniques of
   deep learning to the field of steganography. Nevertheless, existing
   issues like small payload capacity and image distortion have exceedingly
   suffocated the steganographic research. In this paper, we propose
   FakeSafe, a novel cycle-consistent adversarial network proffering
   human-level steganography. Mapping the confidential information into
   fake messages, FakeSafe efficaciously precludes the detection of
   steganalysis algorithms and human eyes. There are three contributions in
   our work: (i) we construct a multi-step FakeSafe mapping, which
   significantly impedes the steganalysis models to identify and recover
   the hidden message; (ii) our steganographic models are robust enough
   since they are applicable to multifarious data domains, including image
   and text information; (iii) we introduce a coverless solution to embed
   the clandestine message within a medium of a specific type in lieu of a
   dedicated cover. We have conducted experiments using both benchmark and
   real-world data sets to demonstrate potential applications of FakeSafe,
   whose open source library is available online at:

Title = {{Digital propaganda, counterpublics and the disruption of the public
   sphere: the Finnish approach to building digital resilience}},
Journal = {{CAMBRIDGE REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS}},
Abstract = {{Drawing on the case of Finland and its model of `resilience' to digital
   disinformation, the article provides an original framework for
   understanding the logic of digital propaganda and the conditions that
   may facilitate an effective response. Building on recent research
   connecting digital propaganda to the disruption of the public spheres in
   democratic societies, the study argues that the logic of digital
   propaganda could be unpacked by examining the mechanisms that facilitate
   the diffusion of disinformation from the microsphere of the daily
   individual experience to the macrosphere of political decision-making.
   It is thus argued that the connection between the two spheres is enabled
   by the formation and political mobilization of `unruly' counterpublics,
   that is, of arenas of textual and visual contestation of politically
   marginalized groups promoting issues aligned with the disinformation
   agenda. Using this framework, the study shows that Finland's resilience
   progress has mostly occurred on the macrosphere level, where effective
   institutions have been applying transparent and proactive policies
   grounded in collaboration and research. However, these efforts are at
   risk of being weakened by the rise of influential counterpublics unless
   Finland takes further measures to protect its public sphere by reducing
   divisions in the microsphere.}},

   work of Harold D. Lasswell and John Dewey to argue that we should study
   the organization of digital publics. For citizens to engage in
   democratic inquiry, publics must be organized so that they can (1)
   easily identify their common interests and (2) regularly encounter
   variety. I then analyze Facebook, showing how the News Feed and Facebook
   Groups together create a platform on which propagandists can effectively
   target and manipulate specific publics. I conclude by turning to Reddit

Abstract = {{Drawing on a qualitative analysis of 5996 tweets and 480 mainstream news
   stories about the Florida State University (FSU) and the Ohio State
   University (OSU) shootings, we examine who emerges as opinion leaders
   during crises, the kinds of narratives they help construct about school
   shootings, and the relative civility of these narratives. We find that
   the opinion leaders who emerge after a crisis are assumed to have local
   knowledge about the incident and/or are able to quickly curate
   information about the incident. In addition, we find that the quality of
   information spread by opinion leaders is critical to narrative
   construction and civility. The largely fact-based narratives associated
   with the FSU incident were far more civil than the OSU narratives, which
   were based on disinformation and polemics. We conclude the article by
   calling on scholars to take a more nuanced approach to conceptualizing
   and studying opinion leaders.}},

Abstract = {{The influence of computational propaganda on democratic processes
   globally has necessitated the exploration of mitigation strategies for
   political brands. The risk associated with computational propaganda
   includes the spread of misleading information about a political brand
   over social networking sites through bots (i.e. automated software
   applications that are programmed to do certain tasks) and newsfeed
   algorithms at rapid speeds. Apart from bots being used to facilitate the
   spread of disinformation (i.e. misleading information spread with the
   intent to manipulate or deceive), human curators also play a role.
   Research into addressing computational propaganda in the field of
   political communication is limited, compelling the need to look to
   consumer brand experts for insight. The current study used
   semi-structured interviews of senior consumer brand social media
   practitioners and applied content analysis to develop a framework for
   mitigating online brand risk associated with computational propaganda
   for political brands. This computational propaganda brand risk
   mitigation framework proposes two approaches to curb the effects of
   computational propaganda, namely, a preventative approach and a recovery
   approach. Based on established theoretical and practical concepts, this
   mitigation framework could guide the easing of online brand risk and
   associated crises for political brands.}},

Abstract = {{Detection of misinformation online requires understanding both the
   sources and content of information. While a variety of supervised
   learning methods have been proposed for automated fact checking with
   respect to the information content of media, the source is usually not
   taken into account. To address this gap in existing methods, we describe
   a novel framework for validating online content based on a knowledge
   graph of media content and an attribution graph of media sources. This
   approach enables decision makers to identify factual information and
   supports counter disinformation operations by tracing the spread of
   disinformation across reliable and unreliable outlets. We have found
   that tracking knowledge provenance is critical to assessing the
   credibility of that knowledge. In addition to building a knowledge graph
   of fact triples (subject, verb, object), we construct an attribution
   graph composed of links between all extracted facts and their sources on
   which we apply our main credibility reasoning mechanism, belief
   propagation. Analysis of credibility based on sources best captures
   reliable knowledge generation processes such as science, legal trials,
   and investigative reporting. In these domains there is a process for
   identifying experts and coming to consensus about the validity of claims
   to establish facts. Our method models these processes in news media by
   considering the relations between credible information and reliable
   sources.}},

   Multi-Class Extremism Text Classification}},
Journal = {{DATA}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Social media platforms are a popular choice for extremist organizations
   to disseminate their perceptions, beliefs, and ideologies. This
   information is generally based on selective reporting and is subjective
   in content. However, the radical presentation of this disinformation and
   its outreach on social media leads to an increased number of susceptible
   audiences. Hence, detection of extremist text on social media platforms
   is a significant area of research. The unavailability of extremism text
   datasets is a challenge in online extremism research. The lack of
   emphasis on classifying extremism text into propaganda, radicalization,
   and recruitment classes is a challenge. The lack of data validation
   methods also challenges the accuracy of extremism detection. This
   research addresses these challenges and presents a seed dataset with a
   multi-ideology and multi-class extremism text dataset. This research
   presents the construction of a multi-ideology ISIS/Jihadist White
   supremacist (MIWS) dataset with recent tweets collected from Twitter.
   The presented dataset can be employed effectively and importantly to
   classify extremist text into popular types like propaganda,
   radicalization, and recruitment. Additionally, the seed dataset is
   statistically validated with a coherence score of Latent Dirichlet
   Allocation (LDA) and word mover's distance using a pretrained Google
   News vector. The dataset shows effectiveness in its construction with
   good coherence scores within a topic and appropriate distance measures
   between topics. This dataset is the first publicly accessible
   multi-ideology, multi-class extremism text dataset to reinforce research
   on extremism text detection on social media platforms. Dataset:

Title = {{Teaching and confronting digital extremism: contexts, challenges and
   opportunities}},
Journal = {{INFORMATION AND LEARNING SCIENCES}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - This paper aims to offer practical guidance on teaching about
   digital extremism - defined here as the intersection of digital
   disinformation campaigns with political extremism - by highlighting four
   pedagogical challenges: the danger of unintentionally ``redpilling{''}
   students; the slippery slope to false equivalency and ``bothsidesism{''}
   in turbulent partisan waters; the difficulty of separating empirical
   analyses from prescriptive debates circulating in popular media; and the
   trouble of getting students to understand digital extremism as a
   sociotechnical problem rather than as a social-or-technical problem. The
   conclusion proposes opportunities for educators to integrate practical
   approaches to confronting digital extremism with digital civics
   curricula.
   Design/methodology/approach - This paper reviews pedagogical challenges
   and outlines a curricular program for teaching about digital extremism
   drawn from the author's experience designing undergraduate courses and
   open teaching modules between 2016 and 2021.
   Findings - Educators should shift focus from the substance of digital
   extremism to its tools social media platforms surveillance and
   data-gathering methods, advertising technologies and monetized
   user-generated content, personalized recommendation algorithms and media
   manipulation strategics that amplify some narratives while suppressing
   others and the media and political institutions that benefit most from
   it. Proposed lessons include: how digital extremists manipulate social
   media metadata; engagement with data creation and targeting practices;
   and analysis of information production, circulation and consumption
   exploring media manipulation tools and their effects.
   Originality/value - This paper's added values are the insights and
   practical recommendations for undergraduate educators teaching on a
   topic of urgent contemporary concern: digital extremism.}},

Title = {{Securitizing cyberspace: Protecting political judgment}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL THEORY}},
Abstract = {{The contemporary debate in democracies routinely refers to online
   misinformation, disinformation, and deception, as security-issues in
   need of urgent attention. Despite this pervasive discourse, however,
   policymakers often appear incapable of articulating what security means
   in this context. This paper argues that we must understand the unique
   practical and normative challenges to security actualized by such online
   information threats, when they arise in a democratic context.
   Investigating security-making in the nexus between technology and
   national security through the concept of ``cybersovereignty,{''} the
   paper highlights a shared blind spot in the envisaged protection of
   national security and democracy in cyberspace. Failing to consider the
   implications of non-territoriality in cyberspace, the
   ``cybersovereign{''} approach runs into a cut de sac. Security-making,
   when understood as the continuous constitution of ``cybersovereign{''}
   boundaries presumes the existence of a legitimate securitizing actor;
   however, this actor can only be legitimate as a product of pre-existing
   boundaries. In response to the problems outlined, the article proposes
   an alternative object of protection in the form of human judgment and,
   specifically, ``political judgment{''} in the Arendtian sense. The turn
   to political judgment offers a conceptualization of security that can
   account for contemporary policy practises in relation to security and
   the online information threat, as well as for the human communicating
   subject in the interactive and essentially incomplete information and
   communication environment.}},

Abstract = {{Professional fact-checkers are becoming essential for the control of
   information and disinformation flows. However, their profile has been
   scarcely studied both internationally and particularly, in the
   Spanish-speaking context. Fact-checking is now a global journalism
   movement, after being consolidated in Anglo-Saxon countries, and has
   become a key for understanding current mediated informative and
   communicative processes that take place in democracies around the world.
   Spanish-speaking fact-checking is growing exponentially in recent years,
   with an increase of more than 500\% in the number of active platforms
   since 2018. Studying the profile of Spanish-speaking fact-checkers is
   crucial to understand the phenomenon in a context of constant
   convergence such as the Hispanic American. A survey (n=52) was conducted
   among Spanish-speaking fact-checkers to analyze their perception of
   fact-checking's link to journalism, the level of collaboration among
   platforms, as well as similitudes and differences between Spanish and
   Latin American professionals. After that, results are enriched through
   13 in-depth interviews to fact-checking professionals and academic

Abstract = {{Traditionally, the idea of being a victim is associated with a crime,
   accident, trickery or being duped. With the advent of globalisation and
   rapid growth in the information technology sector, the world has opened
   itself to numerous vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities range from
   individual-centric privacy issues to collective interests in the form of
   a nation's political and economic interests. While we have victims who
   can identify themselves as victims, there are also victims who can
   barely identify themselves as victims, and there are those who do not
   realise that they have become victims. Misinformation, disinformation,
   fake news and other methods of spreading questionable content can be
   regarded as a new and increasingly widespread type of collective
   victimisation. This paper, drawing on recent examples from India,
   examines and analyses the rationale andmodus operandi-both methods and
   types-that lead us to regard questionable content as a new form of
   collective victimisation.}},

Year = {{2021}},

Number = {{3}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{The fear of the unknown combined with the isolation generated by
   COVID-19 has created a fertile environment for strong disinformation,
   otherwise known as conspiracy theories, to flourish. Because conspiracy
   theories often contain a kernel of truth and feature a strong
   adversarial ``other,{''} they serve as the perfect vehicle for maligned
   actors to use in influence campaigns. To explore the importance of
   conspiracies in the spread of dis-/mis-information, we propose the usage
   of state-of-the-art, tuned language models to classify tweets as
   conspiratorial or not. This model is based on the Bidirectional Encoder
   Representations from Transformers (BERT) model developed by Google
   researchers. The classification method expedites analysis by automating
   a process that is currently done manually (identifying tweets that
   promote conspiracy theories). We identified COVID-19 origin conspiracy
   theory tweets using this method and then used social cybersecurity
   methods to analyze communities, spreaders, and characteristics of the
   different origin-related conspiracy theory narratives. We found that
   tweets about conspiracy theories were supported by news sites with low
   fact-checking scores and amplified by bots who were more likely to link
   to prominent Twitter users than in non-conspiracy tweets. We also found
   different patterns in conspiracy vs. non-conspiracy conversations in
   terms of hashtag usage, identity, and country of origin. This analysis
   shows how we can better understand who spreads conspiracy theories and
   how they are spreading them.}},

Abstract = {{The study raises problems of perception of information, media
   consumption in modern conditions of political and economic influence on
   public opinion through the dissemination of information
   (disinformation). Residents of the Republic of Crimea are in a special
   situation because of an information war is being waged between Russia

   Russia by Ukrainian online media, fakes about Ukraine by Russian media.
   In times of crisis, journalists in the media and authors in social
   networks post many different opinions about the same event. However, the
   same fact is interpreted in completely different ways, depending on how
   it should be presented. Information chaos makes it difficult to find an
   objective point of view.
   The results of the survey show that the Internet is the main source of
   information for Crimeans, but they cannot remember what news sites are
   read (or viewed). At the same time, residents of Crimea criticize the
   news and media politics but overestimate the ability to detect false
   information on the Internet; excessive self-confidence gives more
   opportunities to manipulate public opinion. The article provides

Abstract = {{A sample of 416 online auctions was examined to determine the extent of
   overpayment (winner's curse) where online auctions and e-tail websites
   were linked together to form a parallel sales channel. The results
   indicated that 8.7\% of the highest winning online auction bidders
   exceeded e-tail posted reference prices of identical retail merchandise
   found at the same website. Significantly, such bids exceeded the
   reference prices by a mean percentage dollar amount of 14.1\% thus
   suggesting the existence of a winner's curse. The results also indicated
   that (1) there was a significant negative association between reference
   price and mean percentage dollar amount overbid; (2) there was a
   significant negative association between auction lot size and mean
   percentage dollar amount overbid; and (3) there was no significant
   association between overtime auctions and mean percentage dollar amount
   overbid. While manipulation of reference price and auction lot size
   might minimize winner's curse, erratic or irrational behavior (by online
   auction and/or e-tail websites) may lead to disinformation. 2006

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGIC ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{1, SI}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{There remains a great deal of uncertainty about uncertainty estimation
   in hydrological modeling. Given that hydrology is still a subject
   limited by the available measurement techniques, it does not appear that
   the issue of epistemic error in hydrological data will go away for the
   foreseeable future, and it may be necessary to find a way to allow for
   robust model conditioning and more subjective treatments of potential
   epistemic errors in prediction. In this paper an attempt is made to
   analyze how this is the result of the epistemic uncertainties inherent
   in the hydrological modeling process and their impact on model
   conditioning and hypothesis testing. Some ideas are proposed about how
   to deal with assessing the information in hydrological data and how it
   might influence model conditioning based on hydrological reasoning, with
   an application to rainfall-runoff modeling of a catchment in northern
   England, where inconsistent data for some events can introduce

Abstract = {{The problem area of this paper is informing and information
   manipulation. The paper studies the issues on information disorder and
   identifying fake news, as it is becoming a growing problem, especially
   in digital media that allow their viral dissemination. The paper
   describes the types of information disorders, with an emphasis on
   disinformation and fake news that are most often published with the aim
   of manipulating the audience. In addition, the terms misinformation,
   malinformation and infodemic are terminologically determined. The work
   analyses the ways of fake news spreading, from those spread by people -
   most often through social networks, to the use of computer programs
   (bots). In order to properly identify and respond to information
   disorders, guidelines and tools providing credibility verification of
   information content (online fact-checkers) are presented. Available
   researches suggest that the presence of fake news throughout the media
   is a growing global problem, especially at the time of the coronavirus
   pandemic, but it is not equally present in the countries worldwide.
   Croatia is mentioned as a country where people are able to recognize
   fake news. This original research provides the insight into the
   frequency and the most common ways the students get information, as well
   as their ability to identify fake news. Students prefer to be informed
   through digital media, while the use of traditional media is
   significantly less common. They consider television and radio to be the
   most reliable sources of informing, while the Internet (excluding social
   networks) comes second. Although most students consider themselves
   successful at recognizing fake news, the research findings indicate that
   their real ability to do so is significantly lower.}},

Abstract = {{International and (generally) national law provides for a fundamental

   COVID-19 crisis lies in its global geographical scale and the generally
   concerted political response to it, which included limitations on
   freedom of information. Current limitations differ from those triggered
   by past public health concerns. Taking European countries as case
   studies, the author singles out and analyses in detail three areas of
   concern: restraints on access to information; bans on disinformation;
   and monopolization of the information flow, the latter potentially
   contributing to establishing a `monopoly on truth'.}},

Abstract = {{A time of turmoil and uncertainty is invading the public sphere. Under
   the framework of the 2020 US elections, populist leaders around the
   world supported Trump's speech on Twitter, sharing a common ideology and
   language. This study examines which issues (issue frame), and strategies
   (game frame) framed the messages of populism on Twitter by analyzing the
   equivalences through Trump's storytelling and checking the bias of the
   media in the coverage of the US elections. We selected a sample of
   tweets (n = 1497) and digital front pages of global newspapers (n = 112)
   from the date of the Trump/Biden face-to-face debate (29 September 2020)
   until the Democratic party candidate was proclaimed the winner of the
   elections by the media (7 November 2020). Using a content analysis
   method based on triangulation (quantitative and qualitative-discursive),
   we analyzed the Twitter accounts of five leaders (@realDonalTrump,
   @MLP\_officiel, @matteosalvinimi, @Santi\_ABASCAL, and @Jairbolsonaro)
   and five digital front pages (The New York Times, O Globo, Le Monde, La
   Repubblica, and El Pais). The results show that populist politicians
   reproduced the discourse of fraud and conspiracy typical of Trump's
   politics on Twitter. The negative bias of the media was also confirmed,
   giving prominence to a rhetoric of disinformation that overlaps with the
   theory of populism.}},

Abstract = {{Threat Intelligence is a core component in an effective Cyber Defensive
   Strategy. It allows operational defences to be strengthened in advance
   of emerging cyber-threats, mitigating the impact of potential damage.
   Social influence, disinformation and misinformation are new areas for
   threat intelligence and their impact can be seen in recent international
   controversies surrounding election tampering, civil unrest and
   journalistic integrity. Recent events suggest that influence attacks are
   impacting organisations on a broader scale, with rapid global impact.
   High volume and targeted online traffic add legitimacy that has
   influenced stock value, international sporting events and disrupted
   vaccine programmes. Social influence attacks are also a cybersecurity
   issue that needs to be understood with clear definitions, guidance and
   analysis of tactics, techniques and procedures, in order for the
   cybersecurity community to build appropriate defences and skillsets.
   These types of attacks can be classed as Cyber-Psychological Attacks
   (CPA) and are built on techniques from multiple disciplines. It is an IT
   issue based on the technologies used; it is a psychological issue based
   on techniques applied; and it is a marketing and design issue framing
   psychological techniques to achieve successful outcomes. In isolation,
   all of these elements are not new but when combined, they have the
   potential to create a powerful and effective weapon in cyber warfare.
   This paper presents a review of the effect that social influence attacks
   are having in the context of cyber-threat intelligence. We explore how
   important CPA techniques have become in the broad field of cybersecurity
   as we describe how online influence has been weaponised and deployed to
   significant effect. We conclude with a discussion on the importance of
   cyberpsychological threat intelligence in cyber defence and its
   limitations in the context of emerging threats.}},

Abstract = {{Digital media are critical for contemporary activism-even low-effort
   ``clicktivism{''} is politically consequential and contributes to
   offline participation. We argue that in the United States and throughout
   the industrialized West, left- and right-wing activists use digital and
   legacy media differently to achieve political goals. Although left-wing
   actors operate primarily through ``hashtag activism{''} and offline
   protest, right-wing activists manipulate legacy media, migrate to
   alternative platforms, and work strategically with partisan media to
   spread their messages. Although scholarship suggests that the right has
   embraced strategic disinformation and conspiracy theories more than the
   left, more research is needed to reveal the magnitude and character of
   left-wing disinformation. Such ideological asymmetries between left- and
   right-wing activism hold critical implications for democratic practice,
   social media governance, and the interdisciplinary study of digital

Abstract = {{Media coverage of protests following the murder of George Floyd on May
   26, 2020, tended to ascribe to the demonstrations two faces: One,
   presented by organizers and supporters, was a decentralized movement for
   peaceful change; the other was a violent conspiracy for the disruption
   of order. Good analysis has flowed into the question of domestic media
   bias in the coverage of Summer 2020's historical events. Less attention,
   however, has been directed to the ways foreign media covered the
   protests. One of the most powerful voices in framing the story of the
   protests to a global audience was Russia's statesponsored media behemoth
   RT. And nowhere was RT's particular take on the demonstrations more
   pronounced than its Arabic-language broadcast RT Arabic or RT3. Through
   the lens of discourse analysis, I focus on a small sample of
   quintessential reports to explore how RT3 covered Summer 2020's
   momentous events, what their reporting tells us about Kremlin
   disinformation strategies, and how RT3's coverage of the protests
   factors into the Kremlin's greater geopolitical agenda vis-a-vis the
   Middle East and North Africa.}},

   of the quality of information to which populations are exposed. Selected
   harmful effects have also been observed. It is urgent to mobilize and
   structure public health systems by involving all the required expertise
   to combat health misinformation and better manage the infodemic. Towards
   this end, we are launching a call for critical thinking around three
   themes: the infosphere as a social determinant of health, the
   development of skills in infodemiology, and finally, the development,
   cocreation, and evaluation of consequential interventions to better
   manage the infodemic and combat disinformation. We believe that lessons
   learned collectively from the successful integration of infoveillance,
   infodemiology, and consequential intervention research in our public
   health systems will serve to better address issues emerging from
   infodemics.}},

Abstract = {{Large-scale mobilization is often accompanied by the emergence of
   demagogic leaders and the circulation of unverified rumors, especially
   if the mobilization happens in support of violent or disruptive
   projects. In those circumstances, researchers and commentators
   frequently explain the mobilization as a result of mass manipulation.
   Against this view, evolutionary psychologists have provided evidence
   that human psychology contains mechanisms for avoiding manipulation and
   new studies suggest that political manipulation attempts are, in
   general, ineffective. Instead, we can understand decisions to follow
   demagogic leaders and circulate fringe rumors as attempts to solve a
   social problem inherent to mobilization processes: The coordination
   problem. Essentially, these decisions reflect attempts to align the
   attention of individuals already disposed for conflict.}},

Journal = {{SOCIAL MEDIA + SOCIETY}},

Volume = {{6}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Vigilante groups in the United States and India have used social media
   to distribute their content and publicize violent spectacles for
   political purposes. This essay will tackle the spectacle of vigilante
   lynchings, abduction, and threats as images of vigilante violence are
   spread online in support of specific candidates, state violences, and
   election discourse. It is important to understand the impact of not only
   these vigilante groups, but understand the communicative spectacle of
   their content. Using Leo R. Chavez's understanding of early 2000s
   vigilante action as spectacle in service of social movements, this essay
   extends the analysis to modern vigilante violence online content used as
   dramatic political rhetoric in support of sitting administrations. Two
   case studies on modern vigilante violence provide insight into this
   phenomenon are as follows: (1) Vigilante nativist militia groups across
   the United States in support of border militarization have kidnapped
   migrants in the Southwest desert, documenting these incidents to show
   support for the Trump Administration and building of a border wall and
   (2) vigilante mobs in India have circulated videos and media documenting
   lynchings of so-called ``cow killers{''}; these attacks target Muslims
   in the light of growing Hindu Nationalist sentiment and political
   movement in the country. Localized disinformation and personal video
   allow vigilante content to spread across social media to recruit members
   for militias, as well as incite quick acts of mob violence. Furthermore,
   these case studies display how the social media livestreams and video
   allow representations of violence to become attention-arresting visual
   acts of political discourse.}},

Abstract = {{This article scrutinises the role of discourses on the manipulative use
   of information for Russia-West relations. Debates on so-called
   information warfare have gained prevalence both in the West and in
   Russia. Applying a poststructuralist framework, the comparative analysis
   discusses how these discourses work, respectively, how they interact,
   and what this interaction implies for Russia-West relations. While the
   contemporary discourses facilitate a confrontational stance of both
   Russia and the West towards the respective Other, it is argued, first,
   that these dispositions are malleable. On the long run, Russia-West
   relations are thus not condemned to remain hostile. Secondly, both sides
   still speak to some extent the same language. However, if the current
   cooldown prevails, this common discursive ground may fade and give way
   to more fundamental confrontational stances. Finally, by revealing each
   other's contingency, discourses in both countries make it appear less
   natural which interpretation is `true' or `right'.}},

Abstract = {{Advancements in the AI field unfold tremendous opportunities for
   society. Simultaneously, it becomes increasingly important to address
   emerging ramifications. Thereby, the focus is often set on ethical and
   safe design forestalling unintentional failures. However,
   cybersecurity-oriented approaches to AI safety additionally consider
   instantiations of intentional malice - including unethical malevolent AI
   design. Recently, an analogous emphasis on malicious actors has been
   expressed regarding security and safety for virtual reality (VR). In
   this vein, while the intersection of AI and VR (AIVR) offers a wide
   array of beneficial cross-fertilization possibilities, it is responsible
   to anticipate future malicious AIVR design from the onset on given the
   potential socio-psycho-technological impacts. For a simplified
   illustration, this paper analyzes the conceivable use case of Generative
   AI (here deepfake techniques) utilized for disinformation in immersive
   journalism. In our view, defenses against such future AIVR safety risks
   related to falsehood in immersive settings should be transdisciplinarily
   conceived from an immersive co-creation stance. As a first step, we
   motivate a cybersecurity-oriented procedure to generate defenses via
   immersive design fictions. Overall, there may be no panacea but
   updatable transdisciplinary tools including AIVR itself could be used to
   incrementally defend against malicious actors in AIVR.}},

Abstract = {{The subject of Fake News has recently become very popular, with many
   articles, reports, and even academic events taking up this subject.
   However, media coverage remains generally quite superficial and the
   topic is often approached from the viewpoint of the `accuracy' of the
   information. In this article, I would like to highlight the discursive
   dimension, which I believe to be crucial when looking at Fake News. I
   will therefore seek to approach this issue not from a true/false
   perspective, but rather by considering the processes of turning
   information into discourse, of handling and constructing social reality
   or referents. To this end, I shall first outline the contribution that
   the digital humanities can make to the analysis of meaning in corpora,
   and the way in which they can provide a means to objectively access
   interpretative processes within the information conveyed.}},

   communication concepts and practices, as requested by the European
   Commission to support the implementation of a `General Plan for Risk
   Communication', i.e. an integrated framework for EU food safety risk
   assessors and risk managers at Union and national level, as required by
   the revised EU General Food Law Regulation. We conducted a scoping
   review of social research studies and official reports in relation to
   risk communication in the following areas: understanding and awareness
   of risk analysis roles and tasks, reducing misunderstanding of the
   different meaning of the terms `hazard' and `risk', tackling
   misinformation and disinformation, enhancing confidence in EU food
   safety, taking account of risk perceptions, key factors in trade-offs
   about risks, audience segmentation and tools, channels and mechanisms
   for coordinated risk communications. We structured our findings as
   follows: i) definitions of key concepts, ii) audience analysis and
   information requirements, iii) risk profiling, models and mechanisms,
   iv) contributions to communication strategies. We make several
   recommendations for consideration by the Commission, both in terms of
   actions to support the design and implementation of the general plan,
   and research needs that we consider crucial to further inform
   appropriate risk communication in the EU. EFSA carried out a targeted

Abstract = {{In recent years, prevalent global societal issues related to fake news,

   the (mis-)use of technologies such as AI and VR has been argued to
   potentially fuel this new loss of ``ground-truth{''}, for instance, via
   the ethically relevant deepfakes phenomena and the creation of realistic
   fake worlds, presumably undermining experiential veracity. Indeed,
   unethical and malicious actors could harness tools at the intersection
   of AI and VR (AIVR) to craft what we call immersive falsehood, fake
   immersive reality landscapes deliberately constructed for malicious
   ends. This short paper analyzes the ethically relevant nature of the
   background against which such malicious designs in AIVR could exacerbate
   the intentional proliferation of deceptions and falsities. We offer a
   reappraisal expounding that while immersive falsehood could manipulate
   and severely jeopardize the inherently affective constructions of social
   reality and considerably complicate falsification processes, humans may
   neither inhabit a post-truth nor a post-falsification age. Finally, we
   provide incentives for future AIVR safety work, ideally contributing to
   a future era of technology-augmented critical thinking.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COLD WAR STUDIES}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{23}},

Abstract = {{During the Cold War, Bulgaria was a staunch ally of the Soviet Union,
   and the Bulgarian State Security (DS) service worked extremely closely
   with the Soviet State Security Committee (KGB) on a wide range of
   matters, including disinformation operations as well as ``sharp
   measures{''}-abductions, sabotage, and, most notably, assassinations.
   Not until the Cold War ended and the DS archives in Bulgaria were made
   accessible were scholars able to explore these intelligence operations
   in great depth. Although the lack of access to the KGB's foreign
   intelligence collections in Yasenevo poses certain limits, the
   availability of DS collections, including many copies of KGB records,
   has been a gold mine for Western scholars of Cold War-era intelligence
   activities. Drawing mainly on Bulgarian archival sources, this article
   analyzes KGB-DS intelligence cooperation regarding disinformation and
   ``sharp measures.{''} Among the topics covered are recently disclosed
   sources on the assassination of the dissident Bulgarian writer Georgi
   Markov in London 1978 and the assassination attempt against Pope John
   Paul II in May 1981. The article thus provides historical context for
   contemporary debates about Russian security services and their strategic
   use of disinformation and active measures.}},

Abstract = {{The Covid-19 pandemic has produced not only a terrible sanitary crisis
   but also several problems related to the circulation of disinformation
   in the context of hybrid and increasingly fragmented media systems. In
   this work, we analyze a polemical question included in the Center for
   Sociological Research (CIS) survey conducted in April about the
   appropriateness of limiting free circulation of information to avoid
   diffusion of fake news and disinformation. The goals are to (1) analyze
   the sociodennographic traits of those in favor of limiting the free
   circulation of information, and (2) explore their general political
   preferences and affiliations, and the association with attitudes
   regarding freedom of information. The results obtained through a
   quantitative methodological approach based on contingency tables and
   standardized residuals indicate that the most common sociodemographic
   profile of those in favor of limiting the flow of information is the
   following: young women (between 18 and 25 years) with secondary
   education who live in small municipalities and belong to the lower
   social class. Moreover, the findings illustrate that there is a
   significant statistical association between supporting the limitation of
   information and different indicators of supporting the Socialist
   government: voting and sympathizing with the Socialist Party,
   self-location in the extreme left, and trusting both the central
   government management of the crisis and the leadership of Pedro Sanchez.}},

Journal = {{TELECOMMUNICATIONS POLICY}},

Volume = {{45}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{The governance of information sharing online is a complicated issue,
   especially in context of varying global perspectives on speech rights,
   freedom of expression, the role of news media, and core internet values.
   While discussions of misinformation/disinformation and their like have
   existed for millennia, 2016 marked a move into what some have called a
   ``post-truth era,{''} where information, both true and not, has become
   weaponized for political gain. This paper seeks to examine how
   discussions at the UN Internet Governance Forum unfold by analyzing
   transcripts of misinformation sessions from 2016 to 2019, asking (1)
   What key terms are used most often during these discussions? (2) Have
   and how have these frequent terms evolved over time? Applying the
   CRISP-DM approach to text mining, I find that overall prominent terms
   are ``internet{''} and ``people,{''} though the frequent terms vary
   differently when analyzed by year, showing an evolution of the
   discussion from 2016- ``rights{''} and ``journalists{''}-to 2019-
   ``data{''} and ``content.{''} This study provides insights into the
   de/refining of the causes, vectors of and remedies to the ongoing

Title = {{(Mis)understanding the Coronavirus and How it Was Handled in the UK: An
   Analysis of Public Knowledge and the Information Environment}},
Journal = {{JOURNALISM STUDIES}},
Abstract = {{During the coronavirus pandemic, conspiracy theories and dubious health
   guidance about COVID-19 led to public debates about the role and impact
   of blatant acts of disinformation. But less attention has been paid to
   the broader media environment, which is how most people understood the
   crisis and how it was handled by different governments. Drawing on a
   news diary study of 200 participants during the pandemic, we found they
   easily identified examples of ``fake news{''} but were less aware of
   relevant facts that might help them understand how the UK government
   managed the crisis. Our content analysis of 1259 television news items
   revealed broadcasters did not routinely draw on statistics to
   contextualise the UK's record of managing the coronavirus or regularly
   make comparisons with other countries. Given television news bulletins
   were the dominant news source for many people in the UK, we suggest the
   information environment gave audiences limited opportunities to
   understand the government's performance internationally. We argue that
   misinformation is often a symptom of editorial choices in media
   coverage-including television news produced by public service
   broadcasters-that can lead to gaps in public knowledge. We conclude by
   suggesting the concept of the information environment should play a more
   prominent role in studies that explore the causes of misinformation.}},

Pages = {{169-183}},
Abstract = {{The home lockdown that took place due to the COVID-19 health crisis
   brought about changes in people's daily routines. One of these involved
   their habits when accessing news, which was even more prevalent in
   countries like Spain, one of those hardest hit by the disease and with
   one of the longest lockdowns. Using two online surveys based on
   quantitative and qualitative questions and a semi-structured interview,
   one (N=530) given during the first week of lockdown and the second
   (N=300) at month's end, this article analyses news consumption to
   identify changes in media access routines after one month of
   confinement. The results show that although there was a high level of
   interest in the news during the first week, time spent on news about the
   coronavirus subsequently decreased due to sensations such as information
   overload, stress or anxiety or the absence of novelty, and because
   people followed the media, social networks and journalists more
   selectively. Respondents expressed criticism of disinformation, fake
   news, sensationalism, lack of ethics among certain news outlets and
   constant doubt about the ideological intent of the information.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: The purpose of this article is to propose the reform of
   the regulation in force in Spain on the coverage and treatment of
   information in the audiovisual media during electoral campaigns, in
   relation to the mandatory transposition into Spanish legislation, before
   the end of 2020, of Directive 1808/2018 of audiovisual communication.
   Methodology: For this, a review of the most relevant legislation in the
   field is carried out, including the Organic Law of Electoral Regime
   (LOREG by its acronym in Spanish) of 1985, the different laws of
   creation of public and private media, General 7/2010 Law of Audiovisual
   (LGA by its acronym in Spanish), the European Audiovisual Services
   Directive approved in 2018 and the regulation in other European
   countries on the organization of electoral debates and disinformation
   campaigns. Results: Although the 35 years of validity of the LOREG and
   its jurisprudence condition the legal framework of the audiovisual
   coverage of the electoral campaigns, it is possible to include in the
   transposition and reform of the LGA 7/2010 the regulation of the debates
   and new measures on the protection of pluralism, independence, and
   verification against fake news, issues that a group of Spanish academics
   raised during the public consultation of the Secretary of State for
   Digital Advancement (SEAD by its acronym in Spanish) of the Ministry of
   Economy and Business (MEE by its acronym in Spanish) on the
   transposition of Directive 1808/2018.}},

   cross-national investigation of how news media publish inaccurate
   political information}},
Journal = {{JOURNALISM}},
Abstract = {{This study introduces social norm theory to mis- and disinformation
   research and investigates whether, how and under what conditions
   broadsheets' accuracy norm violation in political journalism becomes
   contagious and shifts other news media in a media market towards
   increasingly violating the accuracy norm in political journalism as
   well. Accuracy norm violation refers to the publication of inaccurate
   information. More specifically, the study compares Swiss and UK media
   markets and analyses Swiss and UK press councils' rulings between 2000
   and 2019 that upheld complaints about accuracy norm violations in
   political journalism. The findings show that broadsheets increasingly
   violate the accuracy norm the closer election campaigns approach to
   election dates. They thereby drive other news media in a media market to
   increasingly violate the accuracy norm as well. However, this holds only
   for the UK media market but not for the Swiss media market. Therefore,
   the findings indicate that the higher expected benefits of accuracy norm
   violation that exist in media markets characterised by higher
   competition outweigh the higher expected costs of accuracy norm
   violation created by stronger press councils' sanctions, and, thereby,
   facilitate contagious accuracy norm violation in political journalism
   during election campaigns.}},

Abstract = {{After waves of public protests that denounced long-time ruling party the
   Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front, Ethiopia has
   experienced a political transformation that, among other things, lifted
   restrictions on political speech and freed prisoners of conscience.
   While the transformative potential of social networking sites across the
   nation in keeping the momentum of the protests was evident, the rise of
   displacements, killings, and violence amplified by ethno-nationalist
   discriminatory discourses on platforms such as Facebook created a
   fervent debate on the role of the state in regulating hate speech
   online. By analyzing data primarily generated from interviews with
   government officials, members of civil society organizations,
   journalists, human rights advocates, and freedom of speech activists,
   this study charts the promises, parameters, and challenges of Ethiopia's
   hate speech and disinformation bill. Findings indicate the Ethiopian
   government's alarm bell on the rise of hate speech in social networking
   sites and the need for an intervention to counter this threat is
   warranted. However, informants expressed serious concerns about the
   government's choice of intervention in the form of a legislative
   response by highlighting the bill's definitional/procedural gaps as well
   as its potential to undermine freedom of speech, the government's track
   record of abusing similar bills in the past to crackdown on legitimate
   expressions of dissent, and lack of implementation capacity. The study
   concludes by offering a comprehensive, multi-stakeholder, long-term
   approach in addition to a legislative response to minimize occurrences
   as well as impacts of hate speech.}},

Abstract = {{Much like a viral contagion, false information can spread rapidly from
   one individual to another. Moreover, once lodged in memory,
   misinformation is difficult to correct. Inoculation theory therefore
   offers a natural basis for developing a psychological `vaccine' against
   the spread of fake news and misinformation. Specifically, in a series of
   randomized lab and field studies, we show that it is possible to
   pre-emptively ``immunize{''} people against disinformation about climate
   change, COVID-19, and elections (amongst other topics) by pre-exposing
   them to severely weakened doses of the techniques that underlie its
   production. This psychological process helps people cultivate cognitive
   antibodies in a simulated social media environment. During the talk,
   I'll showcase an award-winning real-world intervention ({''}Bad
   News{''}) we developed and empirically evaluated in 20 languages-with
   governments and social media companies-to help citizens around the world
   recognize and resist unwanted attempts to influence and mislead.}},

Abstract = {{Post-truth is increasingly in demand among scholars, journalists, and
   ordinary people all over the world. That is why it may be no accident
   that in 2016, the Oxford Dictionary named it a word of the year. Based
   on the wide range of available interpretations of post-truth, the author
   formulates his own definition of this phenomenon as a part of existing
   media and political landscape: post-truth is first and foremost an
   attribute of contemporary media and political reality the essence of
   which is that facts are replaced with subjective, emotional, and
   sometimes false statements. An inference is made that in order to
   successfully combat negative effects of a post-truth media environment
   (i.e. disinformation, misinformation, fake news, manipulation, etc.),
   joint efforts of both institutional and non-institutional subjects are
   needed. These are (but not limited to) nonprofit organizations focusing
   on debunking false information, governmental agencies supporting media
   education programs and developing relevant legislation, and media
   community monitoring the way professional ethical standards and norms
   are abided by. However, efforts of governmental and non-profit
   organizations, as well as the part of professional media community most
   committed to ethic norms, would not be enough to withstand negative
   effects of a post-truth age unless the audience itself develops media
   literacy skills.}},

Abstract = {{Online political advertisements have become an important element in
   electoral campaigning throughout the world. At the same time, concepts
   such as disinformation and manipulation have emerged as a global
   concern. Although these concepts are distinct from online political ads
   and data-driven electoral campaigning, they tend to share a similar
   trait related to valence, the intrinsic attractiveness or averseness of
   a message. Given this background, the paper examines online political
   ads by using a dataset collected from Google's transparency reports. The
   examination is framed to the mid-2019 situation in Europe, including the
   European Parliament elections in particular. According to the results
   based on sentiment analysis of the textual ads displayed via Google's
   advertisement machinery, (i) most of the political ads have expressed
   positive sentiments, although these vary greatly between (ii) European
   countries as well as across (iii) European political parties. In
   addition to these results, the paper contributes to the timely
   discussion about data-driven electoral campaigning and its relation to
   politics and democracy.}},

Abstract = {{During the first wave of the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic of
   2020, the Hungarian government has increased its control over the flow
   of official information. Its actions were justified with the aim of
   stopping the spread of misinformation and rumours that could jeopardize
   its efforts to successfully tackle the pandemic. However, media
   practitioners, watchdogs and politicians in Hungary and abroad
   criticized the measures for their adverse effects on the right to
   information, the freedom of expression, and especially for their
   potential chilling effect on the work of journalists. This
   interview-based study examines how journalists in digital newsrooms have
   perceived the measures imposed during the pandemic, and how those have
   impacted their daily work. As evidence from digital newsrooms shows, the
   malign policy had only limited adverse effects on the work of newsrooms.
   Media pluralism, however, was further decreased in the country through
   the governing political elite's interference in the media economy.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this paper is to analyze the argumentative structure of fake
   news in the Covid-19-era by focusing on its argumentative strength and
   persuasiveness. The concepts of Rhetoric of Reaction (HIRSCHMAN, 1992),
   Ethos and Pathos of Aristotle's Classical Rhetoric and Perelman and
   Olbrechts-Tyteca's New Rhetoric (1996) were the framework for the
   analysis. Our methodology was based on the analysis of three fake news
   reports related to the negationist campaign against the Covid-19
   pandemic, each of which was taken as a prototype of the following
   categories proposed by Hirschman (1992): perversity, futility, and
   jeopardy theses. The results indicate that fake news should be
   understood as an inherently digital phenomenon that uses well-developed
   argumentative strategies as its objective is to cause discredit and
   doubt in the public opinion. Therefore, if we take the average citizen
   into account, fake news is highly persuasive and consequently should be
   considered of extreme danger to society and its democratic and
   scientific principles.}},

Title = {{Re-visiting the Australian Media Arts curriculum for digital media
   literacy education}},
Journal = {{AUSTRALIAN EDUCATIONAL RESEARCHER}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{48}},
Number = {{5, SI}},
Pages = {{873-887}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{This paper re-visits the Media Arts curriculum 10 years after initial
   discussions within the Australian Media Education community helped to
   shape the content and contexts for teaching about media in Australian
   schools. 10 years is a long time in media history, particularly with the
   rise of social media and digital platforms as major venues for
   entertainment, information dispersal and social, cultural and political
   discourse. Media Arts was developed towards the end of the 2000s, when
   the focus in media literacy research was on `participatory culture'-the
   idea that digital media allowed almost anyone to be a media producer and
   consumer. In this context, Media Arts' focus was on identifying the
   knowledge and skills young Australians required to creatively and
   productively participate in media culture. The use of digital media in
   society in the 2010s, however, drew attention to many of the problematic
   consequences of digital participation, including the ambiguous role of
   the digital platforms in mediating social and culture discourse. This
   paper investigates what should be updated in future versions of the
   Media Arts curriculum, particularly to respond to challenges such as
   disinformation, the media industries' shift in power from Hollywood to
   Silicon Valley, and the impact of algorithmic culture on creative
   participation. The paper argues that while is it important for young
   people to develop creative and practical skills to make their own media,
   it is just as important for them to think critically about the
   technological contexts of digital media production, distribution and
   use, and its impacts on society and individuals.}},

Title = {{Social Psychological Predictors of Belief in Fake News in the Run-Up to
   the 2019 Hungarian Elections: The Importance of Conspiracy Mentality
   Supports the Notion of Ideological Symmetry in Fake News Belief}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 24}},
Abstract = {{Accessing information online is now easier than ever. However, also
   false information is circulated in increasing quantities. We sought to
   identify social psychological factors that could explain why some people
   are more susceptible to false information. Specifically, we investigated
   whether psychological predispositions (social dominance orientation,
   right-wing authoritarianism, system justification beliefs (SJB),
   openness, need for closure, conspiracy mentality), competencies
   (scientific and political knowledge, interest in politics) or motivated
   reasoning based on social identity (political orientation) could help
   explain who believes fake news. Hungarian participants (N = 295) judged
   political (anti- and pro-government) and non-political news. The
   Hungarian context-characterized by low trust in media, populist
   communication by the government and increasing polarization-should be
   fertile ground for the proliferation of fake news. The context in making
   this case particularly interesting is that the major political fault
   line in Hungary runs between pro- and anti-government supporter groups
   and not, for instance, between conservative and liberal ideology or
   partisanship. We found clear support for the motivational reasoning
   explanation as political orientation consistently predicted belief in
   both fake and real political news when their contents aligned with one's
   political identity. The belief in pro-government news was also
   associated with higher SJB among pro-government supporters. Those
   interested in politics showed better capacity to distinguish real
   political news from the fake ones. Most importantly, the only
   psychological predisposition that consistently explained belief in all
   types of fake news was a conspiracy mentality. This supports the notion
   of ideological symmetry in fake news belief-where a conspiracy mentality
   can be found across the political spectrum, and it can make people
   susceptible to disinformation regardless of group-memberships and other
   individual differences.}},

Title = {{Deep strategic mediatization: Organizational leaders' knowledge and
   usage of social bots in an era of disinformation}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{51}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{We identified a lack of theoretical concepts and empirical knowledge
   about the perception and usage of social bots from the organizational
   and communication management perspective. Therefore, we first introduce
   social bots in the realm of communication and information management by
   using a profound literature review. Second, by building on mediatization
   theory and strategic communication, we introduce the concept of deep
   strategic mediatization. By surveying the attitudes towards and usage of
   social bots of leading European communication professionals (n = 2,247)
   from 49 European countries, we thirdly offer first indications how
   diverse European organizations in different European regions use social
   bots. Results indicate, that leading communication professionals in
   Central and Western Europe as well as Scandinavia perceive highly
   ethical challenges, while in Southern and Eastern Europe professionals
   are less skeptical regarding the usage of social bots. Only 11.5 percent
   (n = 257) declare their organization uses or are making plans to use
   social bots for strategic communication. They are used primarily for
   identifying and following social networks users. This refers
   specifically to the usage of digital traces for strategic communication
   purposes e.g., to identify topic area opinion leaders or social media
   influencers. However, this represents only a small minority of the
   sample - leading to the conclusion that only a small minority of
   organizations already practice deep strategic mediatization.}},

Abstract = {{The discipline Structural Considerations of Information explores the
   interests underlying communicational dynamics and information
   strategies, as well as the ways in which they correlate with messages.
   Considering this knowledge to be key in Communication Education, and
   having confirmed its close relationship with the dimensions of media
   competence, its presence is analyzed in the Media and Information
   Literacy (MIL) curriculum for teachers, whose training is crucial for
   the success of the process, developed by UNESCO, an organization that is
   a global referent in the field. A semantic content analysis reveals,
   from a quantitative perspective, a strong presence of thematic areas
   covered by the Structural Considerations of Information subject within
   the competencies and contents of the curriculum. However, at a
   qualitative level, there are fundamental weaknesses in its relationship
   with the structural approach to information. This occurs when the
   critical spirit of the text declines, starting with a definition of the
   media as sources of reliable information. The ubiquity of
   disinformation, and the key role played by stakeholders' knowledge, as
   well as the development of critical thinking to address it requires an
   update of this curriculum-the present review contributes to this
   development- highlighting the current necessity to address it from a
   structural vantage that fosters critical citizenship and a democratic
   process.}},

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{12}},
Month = {{SEP 14}},
Abstract = {{This article describes patterns of compliance with social distancing
   measures among the Spanish population during the coronavirus
   disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. It identifies several factors
   associated with higher or lower compliance with recommended measures of
   social distancing. This research is part of a 67-country study, titled
   the International COVID-19 study on Social \& Moral Psychology, in which
   we use a Spanish dataset. Participants were residents in Spain aged 18
   or above. The sample comprises 1,090 respondents, weighted to be
   representative of the Spanish population. Frequencies, correlations,
   bivariate analysis, and six models based on hierarchical multiple
   regressions were applied. The main finding is that most Spaniards are
   compliant with established guidelines of social distance during the
   pandemic (State of Alarm, before May 2020). Variables associated more
   with lower levels of compliance with these standards were explored. Six
   hierarchical multiple regression models found that compliance with
   social distance measures has a multifactorial explanation (R-2 between
   20.4 and 49.1\%). Sociodemographic factors, personal hygiene patterns,
   and the interaction between personal hygiene patterns and the support
   for political measures related to the coronavirus brought significant
   effects on the regression models. Less compliance was also associated
   with beliefs in some specific conspiracy theories with regard to
   COVID-19 or general conspiracy mentality (Conspiracy Mentality
   Questionnaire, CMQ), consumption patterns of traditional mass media
   (television, paper newspapers, magazines, and radio) and modern means to
   get informed (online digital newspapers, blogs, and social networks),
   political ideology, vote, trust in institutions, and political
   identification. Among the future lines of action in preventing the
   possible outbreak of the virus, we suggest measures to reinforce trust
   in official information, mainly linked to reducing the influence of
   disinformation and conspiracy theories parallel to the pandemic.}},

   desinformation were identified. This lacking mechanisms for coordination
   contributed decisively to the tragic epidemiological situation still

   the Mongols (or `Tartars') and the subsequent despatch to the Mongol
   world of three parties of friars (1245-7) as envoys of Pope Innocent
   IV.(2) These texts include:- (1) an early manuscript of the Epistula de
   vita secta et origine Tartarorum of the Hungarian Dominican Julian, who
   travelled to the Ural region in 1236-7 in search of the Hungarians'
   pagan kinsmen in what was known as `Greater Hungary', and returned with
   news of the imminent Mongol assault on Rus';(3) (2) two hitherto unknown
   letters from the Nestorian monk Simeon Rabban-ata to the Emperor
   Frederick II and King Louis IX of France, brought back from Azerbaijan
   in 1247 by one of Innocent IV's envoys, the Dominican Andre de
   Longjumeau;(4) and (3) a second copy of the so-called `Tartar Relation',
   an account produced in Poland in mid July 1247 by a Franciscan friar
   calling himself `C. de Bridia' and closely linked with the most
   celebrated of the papal embassies to the Mongols, which was led by the
   Franciscan John of Plano Carpini and travelled across the Eurasian
   steppes as far as the court of the Qaghan Guyuk in Mongolia.}},

Abstract = {{The infodiet of young Spanish adults aged 18 to 25 was analysed to
   determine their attitude towards fake news. The objectives were: to
   establish whether they have received any training in fake news; to
   determine whether they know how to identify fake information; and to
   investigate whether they spread it. The study employed a descriptive
   quantitative method consisting of a survey of 500 representative
   interviews of the Spanish population aged between 18 and 25 through a
   structured questionnaire. The results indicate that they are aware of
   the importance of training, although generally they do not know of any
   course and when they do, they do not tend to enroll on one either due to
   lack of interest or time. These young adults feel that they know how to
   identify fake content and, moreover, that they know how to do so very
   well. However, they do not use the best tools. While they do not always
   verify information, they mainly suspect the credibility of information
   when it is meaningless. However, they do not tend to spread fake
   information. We conclude that media information literacy training (MILT)
   is necessary in educational centres that focuses on the main issues
   identified.}},

Title = {{``Bullshit!{''} Frankfurt's ``On Bullshit{''} as Analysis of the
   `Post-Truth Attitude'}},
Journal = {{TIJDSCHRIFT VOOR FILOSOFIE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{82}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{5-31}},
Abstract = {{In the aftermath of the `Brexit' referendum in the United Kingdom and
   the election of Donald J. Trump as president of the United States,
   Oxford Dictionaries chose the term `post-truth' as Word of the Year
   2016. `Post-truth' was thereby defined as ``relating to or denoting
   circumstances in which objective facts are less influential in shaping
   public opinion than appeals to emotion and personal belief.{''} Ever
   since, the idea that the Western world has entered a `post-truth era'
   has become widespread among journalists, political commentators,
   sociologists, and psychologists. It should not be surprising that
   philosophers have also weighed in on this topic. Truth is, after all, a
   philosophical theme par excellence, so the popular view that we nowadays
   live in a `post-truth era' cannot but concern them. Furthermore, even
   many non-philosophers refer to a philosophical concept in order to
   interpret the `post-truth phenomenon,' namely the concept of `bullshit'
   as Harry Frankfurt defined it in On Bullshit. None of these analyses,
   however, truly demonstrate why Frankfurt's notion of `bullshit' can be
   considered a precursor of the term `post-truth.' This essay tries to
   substantiate why Frankfurt indeed offers a most useful analysis of a
   `post-truth attitude.' I will discuss four ways in which he
   distinguishes bullshit from lies - namely based on its intention, its
   scope, its method, and its harmfulness - and explain how each of these
   aspects of bullshit also characterize our `post-truth era.' Each time, I
   will consider both those who spread bullshit and those who are exposed
   to it. In this way, I attempt to provide a conceptual framework for
   contemporary phenomena such as `alternative facts,' internet trolls,
   fatigue of expertise, identity politics, the cult of authenticity, and
   disinformation.}},

Abstract = {{To ensure the citizens have the analytical and communication skills
   required to succeed in the 21st century at their disposal requires a
   comprehensive plan which will consider digital and media literacy a
   basic life skill and will integrate this skill into campaigns designed
   to support curricula and social initiatives. Whether it's computers with
   touchscreens or smartphones, the access to information does not
   automatically mean the users know how to effectively use these tools in
   a way that will be beneficial to their daily lives. Everyone should
   benefit from the ability to gain access, analyze and create digital and
   medial content with ingenuity and in a socially responsible way. Digital
   and media literacy should be considered critical at all levels of
   education in a way that would support the development of Slovak
   population in this digital age. More than ever before, the people living
   in this day and age need to allocate the limited resource that is human
   attention to the quality and valuable news that are actually important
   and bring value into their lives. With the increased usage of social
   media, especially for the purpose of communication, there is also an
   increase in the sharing of fake news, hoaxes and other half-truths.
   Through social media, disinformation can spread very quickly, while the
   ability of users to see through it is significantly limited.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose As user-generated content (UGC) is entering the news cycle
   alongside content captured by news professionals, it is important to
   detect misleading content as early as possible and avoid disseminating
   it. The purpose of this paper is to present an annotated dataset of 380
   user-generated videos (UGVs), 200 debunked and 180 verified, along with
   5,195 near-duplicate reposted versions of them, and a set of automatic
   verification experiments aimed to serve as a baseline for future
   comparisons. Design/methodology/approach The dataset was formed using a
   systematic process combining text search and near-duplicate video
   retrieval, followed by manual annotation using a set of
   journalism-inspired guidelines. Following the formation of the dataset,
   the automatic verification step was carried out using machine learning
   over a set of well-established features. Findings Analysis of the
   dataset shows distinctive patterns in the spread of verified vs debunked
   videos, and the application of state-of-the-art machine learning models
   shows that the dataset poses a particularly challenging problem to
   automatic methods.
   Research limitations/implications - Practical limitations constrained
   the current collection to three platforms: YouTube, Facebook and
   Twitter. Furthermore, there exists a wealth of information that can be
   drawn from the dataset analysis, which goes beyond the constraints of a
   single paper. Extension to other platforms and further analysis will be
   the object of subsequent research.
   Practical implications - The dataset analysis indicates directions for
   future automatic video verification algorithms, and the dataset itself
   provides a challenging benchmark.
   Social implications - Having a carefully collected and labelled dataset
   of debunked and verified videos is an important resource both for
   developing effective disinformation-countering tools and for supporting
   media literacy activities.
   Originality/value - Besides its importance as a unique benchmark for
   research in automatic verification, the analysis also allows a glimpse
   into the dissemination patterns of UGC, and possible telltale
   differences between fake and real content.}},

Abstract = {{In 1915, the Constitutionalist faction of Venustiano Carranza moved into
   southern Mexico, promising revolutionary justice and retribution against
   The Reaction. Unfamiliar with the social topography of the region,
   Carranza's men depended on information gleaned from dubious sources to
   make key political decisions. Groups competing for the
   Constitutionalists' patronage flooded Carranza's correspondence,
   accentuating their own revolutionary bona fides while exposing their
   enemies. The result was a political milieu of denunciation, and nowhere
   was this milieu more acrimonious than in Juchitan, a coveted
   transportation hub in the isthmus region of Oaxaca. Using the Carranza
   archive in Mexico City, this essay examines denunciations sent from
   Juchitan in early 1915. These letters reveal an unmediated ``popular
   voice,{''} unbound from the public sphere, its code of honor, and its
   recognition of the realm of privacy. The shift of public politics into
   the private sphere had two important consequences. First,
   unsubstantiated information-rumors, gossip-gained a prominent position
   in local politics. Second, it opened the door to political participation
   to marginalized groups, particularly the working classes and women. This
   essay examines two letters in detail, one from an ``honorable worker{''}
   and the other from a prominent woman, both dealing in rumor, gossip, and
   conspiracy. Despite their inherent unreliability, these letters give us
   a window into the construction of the camarilla, prevailing perceptions
   about politics and the accumulation of wealth, and the possibilities and
   limits of women's participation in high politics.}},

Abstract = {{Both hate speech and disinformation negatively influence the internet's
   potential for public deliberation and lead to polarization between
   political groups. In this paper, we examine the potential of counter
   speech to bolster public deliberation and reduce polarization. In two
   focus groups, we interview participants on what motivates them to engage
   in counter speech in general as well as counter speech favoring
   political adversaries. Firstly, we find a sharp distinction between
   participants who avoid engaging with hate speech and participants who
   actively engage with hate speech in order to combat it. Thus, the most
   important predictor for counter speech favoring adversaries is an
   individual's propensity for counter speech in general. In turn,
   motivations for counter speech in general are a strong sense of
   morality, a perception of the internet as an important space for public
   deliberation, and a sense of responsibility to enforce rules for a fair
   debate. Many of those participants view their online activitiy as a form
   of activism. Additionally, individuals engaging in counter speech hope
   to positively influence not necessarily the hater, but the broader
   audience.}},

Title = {{Behavior-Based Machine Learning Approaches to Identify State-Sponsored
   Trolls on Twitter}},
Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{8}},
Pages = {{195132-195141}},
Abstract = {{In recent years, there has been an increased prevalence of adopting
   state-sponsored trolls by governments and political organizations to
   influence public opinion through disinformation campaigns on social
   media platforms. This phenomenon negatively affects the political
   process, causes distrust in the political systems, sows discord within
   societies, and hastens political polarization. Thus, there is a need to
   develop automated approaches to identify sponsored-troll accounts on
   social media in order to mitigate their impacts on the political process
   and to protect people against opinion manipulation. In this paper, we
   argue that behaviors of sponsored-troll accounts on social media are
   different from ordinary users because of their extrinsic motivation, and
   they cannot completely hide their suspicious behaviors, therefore these
   accounts can be identified using machine learning approaches based
   solely on their behaviors on the social media platforms. We have
   proposed a set of behavioral features of users activities on Twitter.
   Based on these features, we developed four classification models to
   identify political troll accounts, these models are based on decision
   tree, random forest, Adaboost, and gradient boost algorithms. The models
   were trained and evaluated on a set of Saudi trolls disclosed by Twitter
   in 2019, the overall classification accuracy reaches up to 94.4\%. The
   models also are capable to identify the Russian trolls with accuracy up
   to 72.6\% without training on this set of trolls. This indicates that
   although the strategies of coordinated trolls might vary from an
   organization to another, they are all just employees and have common
   behaviors that can be identified.}},

Abstract = {{For displaced people, migrating into Europe has highly complex
   information needs about the journey and destination. Each new need
   presents problems of where to seek information, how to trust or distrust
   information, and financial and other costs. The outcomes of receiving
   poor or false information can cause bodily harm or death, loss of
   family, or financial ruin. We aim to make two major contributions:
   First, provide rich insights into digital literacy, information needs,
   and strategies among Syrian and Iraqi refugees who entered Europe in
   2015, a topic rarely dealt with in the literature. Second, we seek to
   change the dominant perspective on migrants and refugees as passive
   victims of international events and policies by showing their capacities
   and skills to navigate the complex landscape of information and border
   regimes en route to Europe. Building on research at Za'atari refugee
   camp (Jordan), we surveyed 83 Arab refugees in two centers in Berlin.
   Analyses address refugees' temporal information worlds, focusing on the
   importance and difficulty in finding specific information, how migrants
   identify mis- and disinformation, and the roles of information and
   technology mediaries. Findings illustrate the digital capacities
   refugees employ during and after their journey to Europe; they show
   social support via social media and highlight the need for a radical
   shift in thinking about and researching migration in the digital age.}},

Journal = {{NEW MEDIA \& SOCIETY}},
Abstract = {{This study combines data analysis with multilevel processing of visual
   communication to classify the visual frames of state-sponsored social
   media propaganda. We relied on Twitter's Election Integrity data to
   sample five propaganda targets of the Internet Research Agency,
   including Russian and American partisan groups, and explored how their
   operations deviated from canonical state propaganda marked by symbols of
   national identity and heroic masculinity. The results show that the
   visual frames employed by the Internet Research Agency are designed to
   embody the vox populi with relatable, familiar, or attractive faces of
   ordinary people. The results also indicate that Internet Research Agency
   influence operations displayed cultural acuity and familiarity with the
   social identity of their targets, and that the visual narrative the
   agency crafted trafficked primarily in the tropes of regular guys or
   attractive young women. We discuss these findings and argue that
   state-sponsored propaganda has attuned to subcultural and visual
   affordances of social platforms.}},

Abstract = {{Since 2016, social media companies and news providers have come under
   pressure to tackle the spread of political mis- and disinformation (MDI)
   online. However, despite evidence that online health MDI (on the web, on
   social media, and within mobile apps) also has negative real-world
   effects, there has been a lack of comparable action by either online
   service providers or state-sponsored public health bodies. We argue that
   this is problematic and seek to answer three questions: why has so
   little been done to control the flow of, and exposure to, health MDI
   online; how might more robust action be justified; and what specific,
   newly justified actions are needed to curb the flow of, and exposure to,
   online health MDI? In answering these questions, we show that four
   ethical concerns-related to paternalism, autonomy, freedom of speech,
   and pluralism-are partly responsible for the lack of intervention. We
   then suggest that these concerns can be overcome by relying on four
   arguments: (1) education is necessary but insufficient to curb the
   circulation of health MDI, (2) there is precedent for state control of
   internet content in other domains, (3) network dynamics adversely affect
   the spread of accurate health information, and (4) justice is best
   served by protecting those susceptible to inaccurate health information.
   These arguments provide a strong case for classifying the quality of the
   infosphere as a social determinant of health, thus making its protection
   a public health responsibility. In addition, they offer a strong
   justification for working to overcome the ethical concerns associated
   with state-led intervention in the infosphere to protect public health.}},

   scholars, educators, and editors, these anti-propaganda efforts gained
   momentum. Initially, the IPA's monthly newsletter Propaganda Analysis
   and its educational programs, specialized leaflets, and publicity
   campaigns were received favorably by the public. But critics in
   government and the press attacked the IPA's platform. By early 1942, the
   IPA could neither overcome its financial struggles nor thwart social and

Journal = {{INFORMATION COMMUNICATION \& SOCIETY}},
Abstract = {{Responding to widespread concerns about misinformation's impact on
   democracy, we conducted an experiment in which we exposed German
   participants to different degrees of misinformation on COVID-19
   connected to politicized (immigration) and apolitical (runners) issues
   (N = 1,490). Our key findings show that partially false information is
   more credible and persuasive than completely false information, and also
   more difficult to correct. People with congruent prior attitudes are
   more likely to perceive misinformation as credible and agree with its
   positions than people with incongruent prior attitudes. We further show
   that although fact-checkers can lower the perceived credibility of
   misinformation on both runners and migrants, corrective messages do not
   affect attitudes toward migrants. As a key contribution, we show that
   different degrees of misinformation can have different impacts: more
   nuanced deviations from facticity may be more harmful as they are
   difficult to detect and correct while being more credible.}},

Abstract = {{Background Understanding the threat posed by anti-vaccination efforts on
   social media is critically important with the forth coming need for
   world wide COVID-19 vaccination programs. We globally evaluate the
   effect of social media and online foreign disinformation campaigns on
   vaccination rates and attitudes towards vaccine safety. Methods Weuse a
   large-n cross-country regression framework to evaluate the effect
   ofsocial media on vaccine hesitancy globally. To do so, we
   operationalize social media usage in two dimensions: the use of it by
   the public to organize action(using Digital Society Project indicators),
   and the level of negative lyoriented discourse about vaccines on social
   media (using a data set of all geocoded tweets in the world from
   2018-2019). In addition, we measure the level of foreign-sourced
   coordinated disinformation operations on social media ineach country
   (using Digital Society Project indicators). The outcome of vaccine
   hesitancy is measured in two ways. First, we use polls of what
   proportion ofthe public per country feels vaccines are unsafe (using
   Wellcome Global Monitor indicators for 137 countries). Second, we use
   annual data of actual vaccination rates from the WHO for 166 countries.
   Results We found the use of social media to organise offline action to
   be highly predictive of the belief that vaccinations are unsafe, with
   such beliefs mounting as more organisation occurs on social media. In
   addition, the prevalence of foreign disinformation is highly
   statistically and substantively significant in predicting a drop in mean
   vaccination coverage over time. A 1-point shift upwards in the 5-point
   disinformation scale is associated with a 2-percentage point drop in
   mean vaccination coverage year over year. We also found support for the
   connection of foreign disinformation with negative social media activity
   about vaccination. The substantive effect of foreign disinformation is
   to increase the number of negative vaccine tweets by 15\% for the median
   country. Conclusion There is a significant relationship between
   organisation on social media and public doubts of vaccine safety. In
   addition, there is a substantial relationship between foreign
   disinformation campaigns and declining vaccination coverage.}},

Abstract = {{The topic of fake news is not new but its rise is fueled by the digital
   age era. The increased proliferation of fake news has been observed
   since the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) started, thus introducing
   controversy regarding its origin, conspiracies about 5G causing COVID-19
   and COVID-19 home remedies or prevention methods. This information may
   be harmless, or could potentially pose a threat by misleading the
   population to depend on unjustified and unsubstantiated claims. Several
   studies worldwide are investing towards this topic, however, very little
   has been done in the South African context. Therefore, this study aims
   at analysing fake news about COVID-19 spread during the South African
   national lockdown on social media platforms and news outlets; together
   with the measures put in place by the government i.e. social relief
   funds and food parcels. This study took place between March 2020 and
   October 2020 whereby a Google form was used to collect data. The
   collected data was verified using fact-checking websites like Africa
   Check and techniques such as Google reverse image for image
   verification. Thereafter, the data was coded according to these
   categories, namely; misinformation, disinformation, malinformation,
   propaganda and scams, and annotated according to 11 annotation classes.
   The analysis showed that Twitter was the leading source of fake news at
   59\% followed by WhatsApp at 22\%. In addition, most discussions were in
   reference to COVID-19 cures and treatments. Overtime, a correlation was
   observed between events (e.g., change in regulations) that occurred and
   the spread of fake news. To dispel and delegitimise the sources, a
   publicly accessible dashboard was created where all verified fake news
   were shared for easier access. This study has established an
   understanding of the nature of fake news and draws insights that offer
   practical guidance on how fake news may be combated in the future.}},

Abstract = {{The article focuses on the role of the National Socialist ``Austrian
   Legion{''} in connection with the diplomatic relations between Vienna

   attitude towards the NS-refugees from Austria and the question, how
   reliable the informations on the ``Legion{''}, accumulated by Austrian
   authorities, really were. By drawing on primary sources, the article
   shows that it proved to be an enormous problem for the concerned
   Austrian authorities to get reliable informations on the ``Legion{''}.
   The armed units even before the ``NS-Putsch{''} in July 1934 were
   considered a serious threat for Austria's sovereignty In this
   connection, the article especially refers to the reports of the Austrian
   military attach in Germany.}},

Abstract = {{The Internet has evolved into a ubiquitous and indispensable digital
   environment in which people communicate, seek information, and make
   decisions. Despite offering various benefits, online environments are
   also replete with smart, highly adaptive choice architectures designed
   primarily to maximize commercial interests, capture and sustain users'
   attention, monetize user data, and predict and influence future
   behavior. This online landscape holds multiple negative consequences for
   society, such as a decline in human autonomy, rising incivility in
   online conversation, the facilitation of political extremism, and the
   spread of disinformation. Benevolent choice architects working with
   regulators may curb the worst excesses of manipulative choice
   architectures, yet the strategic advantages, resources, and data remain
   with commercial players. One way to address some of this imbalance is
   with interventions that empower Internet users to gain some control over
   their digital environments, in part by boosting their information
   literacy and their cognitive resistance to manipulation. Our goal is to
   present a conceptual map of interventions that are based on insights
   from psychological science. We begin by systematically outlining how
   online and offline environments differ despite being increasingly
   inextricable. We then identify four major types of challenges that users
   encounter in online environments: persuasive and manipulative choice
   architectures, AI-assisted information architectures, false and
   misleading information, and distracting environments. Next, we turn to
   how psychological science can inform interventions to counteract these
   challenges of the digital world. After distinguishing among three types
   of behavioral and cognitive interventions-nudges, technocognition, and
   boosts-we focus on boosts, of which we identify two main groups: (a)
   those aimed at enhancing people's agency in their digital environments
   (e.g., self-nudging, deliberate ignorance) and (b) those aimed at
   boosting competencies of reasoning and resilience to manipulation (e.g.,
   simple decision aids, inoculation). These cognitive tools are designed
   to foster the civility of online discourse and protect reason and human
   autonomy against manipulative choice architectures, attention-grabbing
   techniques, and the spread of false information.}},

Abstract = {{Deceptive information in online news and social media has had dramatic
   effect on our society in recent years. This study is the first to gain
   deeper insights into writers' intent behind digital misinformation by
   analyzing psycholinguistic signals: moral foundations and connotations
   extracted from different types of deceptive news ranging from strategic
   disinformation to propaganda and hoaxes. To ensure consistency of our
   findings and generalizability across domains, we experiment with data
   from: (1) confirmed cases of disinformation in news summaries, (2)
   propaganda, hoax, and disinformation news pages, and (3) social media
   news. We first contrast lexical markers of biased language, syntactic
   and stylistic signals, and connotations across deceptive news types
   including disinformation, propaganda, and hoaxes, and deceptive
   strategies including misleading or falsification. We then incorporate
   these insights to build machine learning and deep learning predictive
   models to infer deception strategies and deceptive news types. Our
   experimental results demonstrate that unlike earlier work on deception
   detection, content combined with biased language markers, moral
   foundations, and connotations leads to better predictive performance of
   deception strategies compared to syntactic and stylistic signals (as
   reported in earlier work on deceptive reviews). Falsification strategy
   is easier to identify than misleading strategy. Disinformation is more
   difficult to predict than to propaganda or hoaxes. Deceptive news types
   (disinformation, propaganda, and hoaxes), unlike deceptive strategies
   (falsification and misleading), are more salient, and thus easier to
   identify in tweets than in news reports. Finally, our novel connotation
   analysis across deception types provides deeper understanding of
   writers' perspectives and therefore reveals the intentions behind
   digital misinformation.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction. Truth and falsity play a dominant role in contemporary
   work on information, misinformation, and disinformation. Discussions of
   these notions typically include remarks about their truth-values, or
   even explicit arguments in favour of their having fixed truth-values.
   Method. I use Chalmers's framework for identifying and potentially
   solving verbal disputes to analyse the discussions regarding information
   and truth.
   Analysis. Philosophical analyses of the discussions of information and
   its relation to truth, as they play out between Luciano Floridi and Don
   Fallis (among others), are carried out in the paper.
   Results. I find that these discussions are in fact a verbal dispute.
   Further, the dominant focus on truth and falsity in the work on
   information, misinformation, and disinformation, within philosophy of
   information, gives rise to a Floridian dilemma: a dilemma in which
   Floridi's definition of semantic information, as inherently truthful,
   turns out to encompass certain varieties of misinformation and
   disinformation while excluding others.
   Conclusion. I recommend that information must be defined as semantic
   content in general without reference to truth, i.e. as truth-neutral,
   such that all varieties of misinformation and disinformation can be
   kinds of information.}},

Abstract = {{In the wake of the panic over fake news that followed the 2016 US
   presidential election, librarians and other information professionals
   are being urged to ``take leadership in the current crisis{''}
   (Jacobson, 2017: 24). The response from the profession has been to
   reaffirm the core values of librarianship and to hold up traditional
   services as a means for combating misinformation. The problem is that
   these solutions are offered in the absence of a full understanding of
   the real danger of misinformation, which is ``not just {[}that]
   misinformation is `out there,'{''} but ``what misinformation does to our
   mind{''} (Ecker, 2015: 22). Misinformation research in other fields
   directly challenges the solutions proposed by library professionals and
   casts doubts on their underlying assumptions. This article provides an
   overview of the library and information science approach to
   misinformation in the United States, discusses the shortcomings of that
   approach, and points to possible next steps for remedying the problem.}},

Journal = {{SOTSIOLOGICHESKIE ISSLEDOVANIYA}},
Year = {{2018}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{84-93}},
Abstract = {{The article uses three main concepts of discourse (conversation)
   analysis school as a key area in modern sociolinguistics (a preconstruct
   as a trace in the discourse of the preceding epochs, supplying material
   for the formation of discourse; interdiscourse as the relations that a
   discourse has to what is ``already heard{''}, ``already present{''};
   intradiscourse as the operation of discourse with respect to itself,
   that is, the phenomena of coreference, which generates the main thread
   of discourse) to build a typology of forms of silence as constructs of
   an ending reality, in which the conceptual beginning of a new reality is
   laid (oblivion, omission, hidden meanings, parables, euphemisms, silent
   scene). Oblivion is regarded as a spontaneous mnemonic mechanism and as
   a technology of instrumental influence on memory, that is, the
   ideologization of memory paralysis is analyzed as the oldest method of
   disinformation, doomed in the modern global space to reduced forms. The
   genesis of hidden meanings is found both in the objective properties of
   the langue and parole phenomenon and in the subjective intentions of the
   utterer. Aesopian language is interpreted as an artistic system of
   paralyses and concealment, worked out over two and a half millennia of
   confrontation between men of letters and authorities. Political
   euphemisms as a soft way to deal with unpleasant subjects are considered
   as a means of tabooing of the modern politics. The mute scene is
   interpreted as meta silence, the synthesis of all possible forms and
   figures of silence. In the article to analyze the unsaid as a key
   discourse construct, demonstrate the illusory nature of the transparency
   of meanings in a text, and explain the principle of discourse being open
   to multiple interpretations, explains the mechanisms of linking separate
   discourse constructs with spots of silence, which, while explicitly
   devoid of any semantics, are implicitly filled with a multiplicity of
   meanings.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose The purpose of this paper is to provide library professionals
   with insights into students' fake news judgment and the importance of
   teaching media and information literacy, not as an option but as a core
   educational requirement.
   Design/methodology/approach Qualtrics was used to collect the study
   data. Students completed a set of tasks designed in the form of a survey
   that entailed verifying whether news, stories, images and news sources
   were real, fake, dubious or trustworthy. Statistical tests were used to
   asses whether their responses depended on criteria, such as faculty and
   gender.
   Findings No significant relationship exists between the students'
   responses and variables, such as gender, student category, fact-checking
   and source of information. The findings reveal that students' ability to
   identify the authoritativeness of information is dependent on the
   faculty in which they are enrolled.
   Originality/value This paper reports the first known attempt in Lebanon
   to measure students' ability in distinguishing fake from real news. The
   results of this paper can be used by library professionals, particularly
   in Lebanon, to convey the importance of teaching and embedding media and
   information literacy into their curriculum.}},

Abstract = {{During the 2016 US presidential election, Americans were exposed to an
   onslaught of disinformation on social media. Many of the most viral
   posts originated from Veles, a small town in central Macedonia. During
   fieldwork in Veles, where we interviewed several residents and
   disinformation creators, we found that the epicenter of this viral
   phenomenon was Mirko Ceselkoski, an autodidact social media expert,
   teacher, and mentor to Veles' fake news operators. We interviewed
   Ceselkoski and registered and attended his online course-the same course
   numerous Veles residents took offline. Our research confirms (1) the
   pivotal role Ceselkoski had in the creation of this industry; (2) the
   economic motivation driving the fake news disseminators; and (3) the
   manner in which the mostly young people in their early twenties with
   little English fluency were able to generate so much traffic and
   disseminate so much disinformation.}},

Abstract = {{In this Q\&A, the Review talks to Delphine van Solinge and Massimo
   Marelli of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). Van
   Solinge is the ICRC's focal point for understanding how digital
   technologies and the spread of harmful information affect populations
   living in conflict environments, and what this means for humanitarian
   action. To this end, her portfolio is focused on exploring, on behalf of
   the ICRC and through partnerships, how to mitigate the risks that
   digital technologies bring in humanitarian settings and ensure relevant
   protection responses in the digital age. Marelli is Head of the ICRC's
   Data Protection Office (DPO). During his tenure with the ICRC, the
   organization has chartered new pathways for how it can carry out its
   operational work, while ensuring that the data of the affected people
   which it serves, as well those of its employees, are well protected.
   During this conversation, van Solinge and Marelli discuss how their
   areas of work complement and reinforce each other, forming two halves of
   the same coin with regard to how digital information and data can both
   be used for positive change and misused in humanitarian settings.
   Marelli highlights how humanitarian organizations process, protect and
   use data and digital information. Van Solinge discusses how through
   misinformation, disinformation and hate speech, information can be
   manipulated and spread using digital technologies - particularly in the
   age of the COVID-19, when populations are more reliant on digital
   communication technologies. Among the issues they discuss are how
   digital technologies can be used positively, the ethical considerations
   that humanitarian organizations should take into account, and the
   possible paths forward for public-private sector collaborations on this
   theme.}},

Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{15}},
Pages = {{1286-1308}},
Abstract = {{The use of disinformation in political campaigns is not a new
   phenomenon, but the issue has acquired renewed attention because digital
   media makes it relatively easier to spread disinformation. Through a
   cross-sectional survey (N = 1,820) on the 2019 Indonesian national
   elections, we analyze the relationship among belief in misinformation,
   social media use, and partisanship. The analysis shows that although the
   political use of social media is not associated with belief in
   misinformation, partisanship is strongly associated with belief in
   various types of misinformation, depending on whether their own
   candidate or the opposing candidate is targeted. The findings are
   interpreted through the concept of selective belief. This study
   contributes to theoretical debates on the association among belief in
   misinformation, social media use, and partisanship, and addresses the
   role of disinformation in electoral politics in Indonesia.}},

Volume = {{13}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Interest in research connected to information disorders has grown
   considerably in recent years. The phrase ``information disorders{''}
   refers to three different notions: dis-, mis-, and malinformation. It is
   difficult to pin down this new and dynamic phenomenon of informational
   disruption and to assess its impact on society. Therefore, we conducted
   a bibliometric analysis on the complexity of information disorders using
   the Web of Science Core Collection database from 1975 to June 2021. We
   analyzed 8964 papers with the goal to have an overall picture of the
   topic, clarify the knowledge framework of research in this field,
   examine the development dynamics, identify future research directions
   and increase the understanding of the research on information disorders.
   The following are our main findings: the number of publications,
   authors, and journals has increased; research on information disorders
   has earned considerable attention in multiple academic fields; there are
   more and more works written in collaboration by scholars from different
   parts and cultures of the world. This paper makes important
   contributions to the literature, not only by providing researchers and
   practitioners with a coherent and perceptible intellectual basis to find
   answers, but also by bringing valuable insights for further
   investigation and future research directions.}},

Abstract = {{Deployment of false targets can be a very important and effective
   measure for enhancing the survivability of an object subjected to
   intentional attacks. Existing papers have assumed that false targets are
   either perfect or can be detected with a constant probability. In
   practice, the attacker may allocate part of its budget into intelligence
   actions trying to detect a subset of false targets. Analogously, the
   defender can allocate part of its budget into disinformation actions to
   prevent the false targets from being detected. In this paper, the
   detection probability of each false target is assumed to be a function
   of the intelligence and disinformation efforts allocated on the false
   target. The optimal resource distribution between target
   identification/disinformation and attack/protection efforts is studied
   as solutions of a non-cooperative two period min-max game between the
   two competitors for the case of constrained defense and attack

Abstract = {{State-sponsored disinformation campaigns increasingly use anti-vaccine
   comments to not only undermine public health but to also reduce
   confidence and participation in a democratic society. Despite these
   dangers, research has not fully explored whether anti-vaccine comments
   can achieve these effects. To address this gap, an online survey
   experiment was conducted using a national sample of 1010 U.S. adults.
   Participants read a mainstream news article discussing the flu vaccine
   that included random variations of user comments adapted from a
   documented state-sponsored disinformation campaign. While exposure to
   anti-vaccine comments did not affect participants' views of vaccines or
   their willingness to discuss vaccines, participants holding pro-vaccine
   views reported lower confidence in news organizations and viewed the
   journalist who authored their article as less credible. These results
   suggest that anti-vaccine comments may produce effects that align with
   the goals of state-sponsored disinformation campaigns.}},

   disinformation purporting to be news threaten the democratic role of
   mainstream media in creating a well-informed citizenry. There is hate
   speech, and disinformation directed at the royal family, the cabinet,
   prominent figures and the larger Swazi society. This study focuses on
   disinformation in the mainstream media, theSwazi Observerand theTimes of
   Swaziland, and the strategies being adopted to combat it. The article
   adopts a qualitative methodological approach using in-depth interviews
   with journalists and qualitative content analysis of the newspapers as
   data-gathering methods. The study reveals that the dissemination of
   false information is partially a consequence of the secretive nature of
   Swazi society even on matters of public interest. This has resulted in
   people spreading false news through social media aimed at ridiculing
   those in authority. On the other hand, ``fake news{''} has found its way
   into mainstream media as journalists use the internet and social media
   such as Facebook and Twitter as sources of news without verifying their
   authenticity due to the pressure to be the first to publish.}},

Abstract = {{Policy-makers are confronted with complex problems that require
   evaluating multiple streams of evidence and weighing competing interests
   to develop and implement solutions. However, the policy interventions
   available to resolve these problems have different levels of supporting
   scientific evidence. Decision-makers, who are not necessarily
   scientifically trained, may favour policies with limited scientific
   backing to obtain public support. We illustrate these tensions with two
   case studies where the scientific consensus went up against the
   governing parties' chosen policy. What mechanisms exist to keep the
   weight of scientific evidence at the forefront of decision-making at the
   highest levels of government? In this paper, we propose that Canada
   create ``Departmental Chief Science Advisors{''} (DCSAs), based on a
   program in the UK, to help complement and extend the reach of the newly
   created Chief Science Advisor position. DCSAs would provide advice to
   ministers and senior civil servants, critically evaluate scientific work
   in their host department, and provide public outreach for the
   department's science. We show how the DCSAs could be integrated into
   their departments and illustrate their potential benefits to the policy
   making process and the scientific community.}},

Abstract = {{Libraries have long existed to assist users in accessing accurate
   information for their needs. Industry has long been motivated to spread
   disinformation to promote their industry's message to the public.
   Although corporate disinformation techniques perfected by the tobacco
   industry in the 1950's were exposed, instead of disappearing they have
   only grown more influential with the rise of the internet. Many
   industries from petroleum to pharmaceuticals use scientific research to
   promote their corporate message and have contributed to harming the
   public. Users need information literacy (IL) to provide them with the
   skills they need to critically evaluate information and reject the
   techniques of disinformation. This essay will argue that librarians
   should provide instruction about conflict of interest (COI) while
   instructing users in evaluation, and that the Framework for Information
   Literacy (2016) can provide a structure for this instruction. Libraries
   can help their patrons exercise critical skepticism when evaluating
   information to avoid becoming disinformed. It concludes with a call for
   librarians to be more cognizant of issues of money and power when
   evaluating information to assist users with making the choices that best
   meet their information needs.}},

Abstract = {{Recent events, such as the 2016 US Presidential Campaign, Brexit and the
   COVID-19 ``infodemic{''}, have brought into the spotlight the dangers of
   online disinformation. There has been a lot of research focusing on
   fact-checking and disinformation detection. However, little attention
   has been paid to the specific rhetorical and psychological techniques
   used to convey propaganda messages. Revealing the use of such techniques
   can help promote media literacy and critical thinking, and eventually
   contribute to limiting the impact of ``fake news{''} and disinformation
   campaigns.
   Prta (Propaganda Persuasion Techniques Analyzer) allows users to explore
   the articles crawled on a regular basis by highlighting the spans in
   which propaganda techniques occur and to compare them on the basis of
   their use of propaganda techniques. The system further reports
   statistics about the use of such techniques, overall and over time, or
   according to filtering criteria specified by the user based on time
   interval, keywords, and/or political orientation of the media. Moreover,
   it allows users to analyze any text or URL through a dedicated interface
   or via an API. The system is available online:

Year = {{2020}},

Month = {{JUN 18}},
Abstract = {{The advent of social media changed the way we consume content, favoring
   a disintermediated access to, and production of information. This
   scenario has been matter of critical discussion about its impact on
   society, magnified in the case of the Arab Springs or heavily criticized
   during Brexit and the 2016 U.S. elections. In this work we explore
   information consumption on Twitter during the 2019 European Parliament
   electoral campaign by analyzing the interaction patterns of official
   news outlets, disinformation outlets, politicians, people from the
   showbiz and many others. We extensively explore interactions among
   different classes of accounts in the months preceding the elections,
   held between 23rd and 26th of May, 2019. We collected almost 400,000
   tweets posted by 863 accounts having different roles in the public
   society. Through a thorough quantitative analysis we investigate the
   information flow among them, also exploiting geolocalized information.
   Accounts show the tendency to confine their interaction within the same
   class and the debate rarely crosses national borders. Moreover, we do
   not find evidence of an organized network of accounts aimed at spreading
   disinformation. Instead, disinformation outlets are largely ignored by
   the other actors and hence play a peripheral role in online political
   discussions.}},

Volume = {{29}},

Pages = {{150-158}},
Abstract = {{Purpose The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of the
   philosophical considerations of fake news and provide an alternative
   view to current conceptualizations of its binary nature. Through an
   evaluation of existing research, a typology of fake news is presented
   that considers the possibility that the propagation of fake news about a
   brand, may be stemming from the brand itself, a previously unexplored
   field in the literature.
   Design/methodology/approach This is a conceptual paper based on
   extensive literature review on the fields of fake news and knowledge
   creation, resulting in the creation of a synthesized typology.
   Findings The role of power structures greatly influences the ability for
   a brand to respond to fake news. Externally constructed disinformation
   is seemingly more difficult for a brand to address, as a result of
   having limited control over the message. Internally constructed
   information, while stemming from the brand itself provides the brand
   with more control, but a greater public distrust as the source of the
   fake news seems to confirm the disinformation.
   Practical implications This paper presents a typology that contrasts the
   source of the construction of disinformation and the extent to which the
   facts have been fabricated. Furthermore, this paper provides future
   researchers with an alternate understanding of the conceptualization of
   fake news.
   Originality/value This paper is the first of its kind to establish a
   typology of fake news on the basis of the source of construction of
   disinformation. The source plays an important role when assessing the
   associated brand risks and developing an approach to combat potential
   negative implications.}},

Journal = {{WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{52}},
Number = {{3}},

Abstract = {{The use of additional types of observational data has often been
   suggested to alleviate the ill-posedness inherent to parameter
   estimation of groundwater models and constrain model uncertainty.
   Disinformation in observational data caused by errors in either the
   observations or the chosen model structure may, however, confound the
   value of adding observational data in model conditioning. This paper
   uses the global generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation
   methodology to investigate the value of different observational data
   types (heads, fluxes, salinity, and temperature) in conditioning a
   groundwater flow and transport model of an extensively monitored field
   site in the Netherlands. We compared model conditioning using the real
   observations to a synthetic model experiment, to demonstrate the
   possible influence of disinformation in observational data in model
   conditioning. Results showed that the value of different conditioning
   targets was less evident when conditioning to real measurements than in
   a measurement error-only synthetic model experiment. While in the
   synthetic experiment, all conditioning targets clearly improved model
   outcomes, minor improvements or even worsening of model outcomes was
   observed for the real measurements. This result was caused by errors in
   both the model structure and the observations, resulting in
   disinformation in the observational data. The observed impact of
   disinformation in the observational data reiterates the necessity of
   thorough data validation and the need for accounting for both model
   structural and observational errors in model conditioning. It further
   suggests caution when translating results of synthetic modeling examples
   to real-world applications. Still, applying diverse conditioning data
   types was found to be essential to constrain uncertainty, especially in
   the transport of solutes in the model.}},

Month = {{MAY-JUN}},
Abstract = {{The global health crisis arising from the expansion of Covid-19 has led
   the WHO to coin the term infodemics to define a situation of fear and
   insecurity in which the dissemination of false information has become
   widespread. These hoaxes take advantage of this type of emotion to
   spread faster than the coronavirus itself, generating fear and distrust
   in the population. The spread of these lies, part of which circulates on
   social networks, is dangerous because it affects health and can make the
   contagion worse and cause people to die. This research aims to analyse
   and visualise the network created around the false news circulating on
   Twitter about the coronavirus pandemic using the technique of social
   network analysis. NodeXL Pro software has been used. Several measures of
   network centrality have been used to generate the network of connections
   between users, to represent their interaction patterns and to identify
   the key actors within the network. In addition, a semantic network has
   also been created to discover the differences in the way groups of
   people talk about the topic. The results show that the situation in the
   USA dominates the conversation, despite the fact that at that time there
   were hardly any cases, and Europe had become the global epicentre of the
   Covid-19. Despite reports of inaction by journalists and critics of the
   Trump government, there are several weeks in which disinformation
   distracts from taking more effective action and actually preventing
   contagion. Moreover, among the actors with the most prominent positions
   in the network, there is little presence of scientists and institutions
   that help to disprove the hoaxes and explain the hygiene measures.}},

Abstract = {{This article discusses how populism and political uncertainty are
   impacting on one of the main current trends in the Area of Freedom,

   exploration of a cybersecurity policy case study, the article proposes
   to understand how the privatisation of internal security, which has
   resulted in private actors shaping JHA policies and regulation, is
   currently being disrupted. Through the use of the theoretical lenses of
   Regulatory Capitalism, the article argues that this change is directly
   related to a reduction in trust relations between the State and certain
   private sector actors, which occurs when priorities in addressing
   populism and political uncertainty are perceived to diverge.}},

Abstract = {{Thousands of videos are posted online every day. The affordability of
   video editing tools and social networks has facilitated the creation and
   spread of videos carrying disinformation, i.e. fake videos. Previous
   attempts to categorize disinformation have focused on content analysis
   and ascertaining the intention of creators. To extend these approaches,
   it is beneficial to incorporate the perspective of other fields that
   study the trustworthiness of records, such as archival science, to help
   detect and categorize fake videos. This paper proposes to leverage
   archival science in combination with computer engineering to devise a
   new framework for detecting and categorizing fake videos. In doing so,
   the paper offers a rime study of the way in which Computational Archival
   Science, which blends archival and computational thinking, can be used
   to contribute to a novel approach towards solving the problem of fake
   videos.}},

Abstract = {{If we have learned anything since the 2016 election, it is that foreign
   election interference is not just a strategic tool used by Russia. Many
   countries are now using social media disinformation as statecraft to
   attack democracies. With a relatively small investment of personnel and
   financial resources, a foreign power can use social media and other
   online tools to heighten divisions in the electorate, spread
   disinformation and conspiracy theories, and undermine confidence in the
   electoral system specifically and democratic institutions generally. The
   Biden administration should use the moral, political, and legal
   authorities of the Executive Branch to protect the United States from
   foreign election interference. In parallel, it should work cooperatively
   with allies to combat election interference using multilateral
   initiatives.}},

   parties who can monitor users' content from the point where the content
   leaves users' computers to within the data centers of these information
   accumulators. To achieve this goal, our framework proactively uses the
   principles of suppression of sensitive data and disinformation.
   Moreover, we use social-hots in a novel way for enhanced privacy and
   provide users' with plausible deniability for their photos, audio, and

Abstract = {{The term ``fake news{''} gained international popularity as a result of
   the 2016 US presidential election campaign. It is related to the
   practice of spreading false and/or misleading information in order to
   influence popular opinion. This practice is known as disinformation. It
   is one of the main weapons used in information warfare, which is listed
   as an emerging cybersecurity threat. In this paper, we explore ``fake
   news{''} as a disinformation tool. We survey previous efforts in
   defining and automating the detection process of ``fake news{''}. We
   establish a new fluid definition of ``fake news{''} in terms of relative
   bias and factual accuracy. We devise a novel framework for fake news
   detection, based on our proposed definition and using a machine learning
   model.}},

Journal = {{IFLA JOURNAL-INTERNATIONAL FEDERATION OF LIBRARY ASSOCIATIONS}},
Abstract = {{Traversing scientific information has become increasingly fraught, as
   the new information landscape allows anyone to access endless
   information with a few keystrokes. However, those trying to find
   information, understand authorities and navigate experts need a deeper
   understanding not only of the information itself, but also of how and
   why information is shared. Increasingly, questions of expertise, locale
   and bias are driving the scientific information ecosystem and creating
   or expanding disinformation, misinformation and propaganda efforts.
   Librarians are in the centre of this maelstrom of information and are
   obligated to help people learn to be critical of information. This
   article presents an illustrative case study, using the example of
   scientific information around the safety and efficacy of the
   Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine to demonstrate how modern scientific
   information sharing is shaped by the ways in which misinformation and
   fake news spread.}},

Title = {{Characterizing networks of propaganda on twitter: a case study}},
Journal = {{APPLIED NETWORK SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{SEP 4}},
Abstract = {{The daily exposure of social media users to propaganda and
   disinformation campaigns has reinvigorated the need to investigate the
   local and global patterns of diffusion of different (mis)information
   content on social media. Echo chambers and influencers are often deemed
   responsible of both the polarization of users in online social networks
   and the success of propaganda and disinformation campaigns. This article
   adopts a data-driven approach to investigate the structuration of
   communities and propaganda networks on Twitter in order to assess the
   correctness of these imputations. In particular, the work aims at
   characterizing networks of propaganda extracted from a Twitter dataset
   by combining the information gained by three different classification
   approaches, focused respectively on (i) using Tweets content to infer
   the ``polarization{''} of users around a specific topic, (ii)
   identifying users having an active role in the diffusion of different
   propaganda and disinformation items, and (iii) analyzing social ties to
   identify topological clusters and users playing a ``central{''} role in
   the network. The work identifies highly partisan community structures
   along political alignments; furthermore, centrality metrics proved to be
   very informative to detect the most active users in the network and to
   distinguish users playing different roles; finally, polarization and
   clustering structure of the retweet graphs provided useful insights
   about relevant properties of users exposure, interactions, and
   participation to different propaganda items.}},

Abstract = {{This article explores the extent to which Covid-19 has impacted the
   trajectory of EU Cybersecurity Policy. The Covid-19 crisis has led to an
   unprecedent reliance on digital solutions, ranging from teleworking to
   virus-tracking systems, resulting in the proliferation of Covid-19
   related cybercrime, critical information infrastructure attacks and
   dissemination of pandemic disinformation. Although the virus has been
   repeatedly portrayed as life altering and as having considerably
   increased the cybersecurity risks faced by States, businesses and
   citizens, the proposed solutions, however, have accelerated existing
   trends in the field rather than resulting in significant institutional
   change. In particular, there has been a reinforcement of the role as a
   coordinating actor, of the introduction of further coherence between
   sub-areas and instruments, and of the positioning of public-private
   partnerships at the heart of the policy. However, where the role of
   social media platforms in facilitating the spread of disinformation is
   concerned, a changing trust relationship has resulted in a discursive
   shift in which these platforms require greater oversight, a belief
   reinforced by the spread of Covid-19 disinformation. The article
   proposes, through the lenses of historical and discursive
   institutionalism, that the EU's response to Covid-19 in the field of
   cybersecurity can only be understood in light of these pre-existing
   trends, which are the result of an economic and security path dependence
   that emerged in the 1980s.}},

Abstract = {{Fact-checking has gained importance in recent years, as so-called ``fake

   independent organizations engage in debunking to combat the massive
   spread of disinformation. However, several authors have argued that fact
   checkers can only be successful if they win the trust of the audience -
   by making their practices transparent. This article analyzes the degree
   of source transparency provided by eight fact checkers from different
   countries (the US, the UK, Germany, and Austria). The findings show
   major differences among the outlets studied which can be attributed to
   varying levels of journalistic professionalism as well as to
   organizational differences. Implications for the success of
   fact-checking and solutions to combat online disinformation are
   discussed.}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Objectives: The objective of this study was to analyse the media
   discourse about the AstraZeneca COVID19 vaccine on Twitter. Study
   design: The study design used in this study is data scraping, media
   analysis, social network analysis, and botometer. Methods: We collected
   221,922 tweets containing `\#AstraZeneca' from 1 January 2021 to 22
   March 2021. From 50,080 tweets in the English language, we analysed the
   linked media sources and conducted a network detection study. Results:
   We found that the most frequently retweeted tweets were full of negative
   information, and in many cases came from media sources that are
   well-known for misinformation. Our analysis identified large
   coordination networks involved in political astroturfing and vaccine
   diplomacy in South Asia but also vaccine advocacy networks associated
   with European Commission employees. Conclusions: The results of this
   study show that Twitter discourse about \#AstraZeneca is filled with
   misinformation and bad press, and may be distributed not only
   organically by anti-vaxxer activists but also systematically by
   professional sources. (c) 2021 The Royal Society for Public Health.

   date, efforts have centered on improving the content, accessibility, and
   delivery of scientific communications. Here we argue that in the current
   political and media environment faulty communication is no longer the
   core of the problem. Distrust in the scientific enterprise and
   misperceptions of scientific knowledge increasingly stem less from
   problems of communication and more from the widespread dissemination of
   misleading and biased information. We describe the profound structural
   shifts in the media environment that have occurred in recent decades and
   their connection to public policy decisions and technological changes.
   We explain how these shifts have enabled unscrupulous actors with
   ulterior motives increasingly to circulate fake news, misinformation,
   and disinformation with the help of trolls, bots, and respondent-driven
   algorithms. We document the high degree of partisan animosity, implicit
   ideological bias, political polarization, and politically motivated
   reasoning that now prevail in the public sphere and offer an actual
   example of how clearly stated scientific conclusions can be
   systematically perverted in the media through an internet-based campaign
   of disinformation and misinformation. We suggest that, in addition to
   attending to the clarity of their communications, scientists must also
   develop online strategies to counteract campaigns of misinformation and
   disinformation that will inevitably follow the release of findings
   threatening to partisans on either end of the political spectrum.}},

Abstract = {{The media ecosystem is constantly changing, transforming at a rhythm
   that educational institutions cannot keep up with. In this media
   transformation, artificial intelligence (AI) has been introduced,
   adapted to social networks for various purposes, including political
   ones. This work focuses on AI in bot format as an automated tool to
   publish content on Twitter and on the skills needed to identify them.
   Bots seek to imitate human behaviour to create a climate of concrete
   opinion, participate in political conversations and interact with real
   accounts in order to boycott them or increase their relevance. In order
   to know the level of media literacy of journalism students and increase
   their skills to identify this type of manipulation of the public sphere,
   a teaching intervention is designed at university level, applied to a
   sample of 55 students, consisting of a workshop to identify bots on
   Twitter. From the results of the workshop, evaluated through
   questionnaires, it is observed that the students have previous skills
   acquired informally to detect bots and that after the workshop the
   ability to identify these accounts slightly increases and, above all,
   they manifest a more conscious process when they face them. This paper
   presents the design of the workshop and its evaluation.}},

Abstract = {{Digital disinformation presents a challenging problem for democracies
   worldwide, especially in times of crisis like the COVID-19 pandemic. In
   countries like Singapore, legislative efforts to quell fake news
   constitute relatively new and understudied contexts for understanding
   local information operations. This paper presents a social cybersecurity
   analysis of the 2020 Singaporean elections, which took place at the
   height of the pandemic and after the recent passage of an anti-fake news
   law. Harnessing a dataset of 240,000 tweets about the elections, we
   found that 26.99\% of participating accounts were likely to be bots,
   responsible for a larger proportion of bot tweets than the election in
   2015. Textual analysis further showed that the detected bots used
   simpler and more abusive second-person language, as well as hashtags
   related to COVID-19 and voter activity-pointing to aggressive tactics
   potentially fuelling online hostility and questioning the legitimacy of
   the polls. Finally, bots were associated with larger, less dense, and
   less echo chamber-like communities, suggesting efforts to participate in
   larger, mainstream conversations. However, despite their distinct
   narrative and network maneuvers, bots generally did not hold significant
   influence throughout the social network. Hence, although intersecting
   concerns of political conflict during a global pandemic may promptly
   raise the possibility of online interference, we quantify both the
   efforts and limits of bot-fueled disinformation in the 2020 Singaporean
   elections. We conclude with several implications for digital
   disinformation in times of crisis, in the Asia-Pacific and beyond.}},

Abstract = {{While the use of additional types of observational data has often been
   suggested to alleviate the ill-posedness inherent to parameter
   estimation of distributed groundwater models and constrain model
   uncertainty. Previous quantification of the value of different
   observational data may, however, have suffered from neglecting
   equifinality and disinformation through errors in model structure and
   observations. This paper investigates the value of different
   observational data types (pressure, fluxes, salinity and temperature) in
   conditioning a groundwater flow and transport model of an extensively
   monitored field site, accounting for equifinality of model parameters
   and errors in model structure and observational data. Results showed
   that the value of different conditioning data was less evident than
   expected, as different data types did not constrain additional
   parameters, and some parameters were constrained to different regions of
   the parameter space. This result was caused by hydrological specifics of
   the modeled problem, strong equifinality in the model, and
   disinformation in observational data. The apparent disinformation in
   observational data suggests caution when translating results of
   synthetic modeling examples to real-world applications. Applying diverse
   conditioning data types, however, was found essential to constrain
   uncertainty in not only simulated heads and flow, but also in the
   transport of solutes in the model. Constrained on different
   observational data types, the model showed the interplay between
   pressure wave celerity and water velocity to drive salinity dynamics in
   exfiltrating groundwater on different timescales.}},

Abstract = {{The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has brought forward the centrality of
   public communication as a force for information, and in highlighting the
   differential impact on diverse segments of the society. Information and
   communication technologies-led developments including social media have
   previously been discussed as instruments of democratization of
   knowledge. However, the evidence so far shows that the promise remains
   unfulfilled as upper socioeconomic groups acquire information at a
   faster rate than others. The communication inequalities have only
   reinforced the existing societal fault lines of race, class and place.
   As the first pandemic of the social media age, COVID-19 has also given
   rise to an ``infodemic{''}, providing fertile ground for the spread of
   information, misinformation and disinformation. With limited
   gatekeeping, an immense amount of unprocessed scientific information is
   being put forward to publics not trained in science.
   In this commentary, we offer some propositions on how disinformation on
   COVID-19 has become mainstreamed through social media's spiral of
   amplification and what role public communication has in an emergency
   from a lens of equity. We raise the question of whether the tremendous
   flow of scientific information during the COVID-19 pandemic has a
   differential impact on different socioeconomic groups. We propose that
   more systematic research is urgently needed to understand how
   mis/disinformation originate, spread and what their consequences are. In
   our view, research in health communication inequalities is foundational
   to mitigating the current off-line and online ravages of the pandemic.}},

Abstract = {{The birth of the post-truth era, i.e. the advent of alternative media
   and internet social networks, has brought along a great deal of
   demagoguery, nonsense, lies, hoaxes, disinformation (a trendier term
   being `fake news') and conspiracy theories, with propaganda and
   manipulation being the key features here. Dissemination of
   disinformation and its effects on individuals, society and politics are
   among the most debated topics of our day, although, frankly, it is in
   fact a very old phenomenon. The advent of digital media has brought,
   apart from other things, a decline of public trust in traditional
   (mainstream) media, and conversely a boom in alternative information
   sources. Meanwhile, it is not entirely clear what the term alternative
   with respect to mass media should actually mean. Perhaps free media?
   Independent media? Attempts to define alternative media against the
   background of mainstream media contain quite a few options to grasp the
   alternateness. In our contribution we endeavour to find the causes of
   the strongly negative connotations surrounding the term alternative
   media. This term is not infrequently linked to an unprecedented rise of
   media with disinformation and conspiracy agenda. Nevertheless, we point
   out why it perhaps should be more appropriate to grasp this term in a
   more neutral way, not only in academia, considering that such sources in
   many cases provide scope for different interpretation of the dominant
   ideology in society and information disseminated under its aegis.}},

Abstract = {{Indonesia is no stranger to misinformation, especially during the
   COVID-19 outbreak in early 2020. From 1 January 2020 to 15 April 2020,
   the Indonesian Ministry of Communication and Information was able to
   identify 534 misinformation circulating in the country. False
   information during a pandemic may pose a serious threat to public
   health. Therefore, this study aims to identify the type and claims of
   misinformation from all 534 articles. Also, based on the results, this
   study aims to give recommendations for dealing with misinformation in
   Indonesia. This research uses a qualitative approach through systematic
   analysis, where all articles were analyzed by three human coders based
   on a predefined coding scheme. Results show that the most common type is
   a reconfiguration from old or genuine materials compared to fully
   fabricated content. While the most common claims are concerning
   community spread and public authority action. Based on the results, this
   paper recommends reducing the number of misinformation through three
   perspectives - identification of misinformation, platforms, and support
   for targeted people.}},

Abstract = {{Applying an interdisciplinary approach, the author raises the question
   of the meaning and scope of the term ``global information law{''}. If
   the information law is considered as a global regulator of the
   information technology space, then the issue of the acceptability and
   expediency of using the term `` information technology space{''} in the
   singular should be addressed initially. According to the author's
   opinion, such spaces, first, are divided into two relatively independent
   classes (official and unofficial information spaces). Secondly, such
   spaces may strive for self-isolation on a professional, ethnic,
   socio-cultural basis. Thirdly, given the impossibility of formulating a
   generally accepted definition of information, it is very difficult to
   distinguish it from disinformation, as well as propaganda and counter
   propaganda. The boundaries of ``information{''} are usually blurred at
   the junction of m (conscious or unconscious) disinformation, as well as
   with directed propaganda or counter propaganda.}},

Abstract = {{The article addresses the understanding of misinformation as a
   phenomenon that goes far beyond the term ``false news{''}, increasingly
   known in Anglo-Saxon idiom `Fake news'. These terms have been
   appropriate and misleadingly used by powerful actors to dismiss the
   information coverage leading to complete disinformation and, therefore,
   to a dizzying fall in credibility. Disinformation, as we discussed in
   this article, includes all forms of false, inaccurate or misleading
   information designed, presented and promoted to intentionally cause
   public harm or for profit. To counteract this phenomenon, institutions,
   organizations, universities and governments have been promoting various
   initiatives. Many of these initiatives are based on artificial
   intelligence that, with the art of algorithms, design and develop bots
   and platforms whose objective is to fight against the toxicity of
   information. The article analyzes the main developments of bots used to
   minimize the impact of fake news.}},

Abstract = {{The proliferation of mis/disinformation in the media has had a profound
   impact on social discourse and politics in the United States. Some argue
   that democracy itself is threatened by the lies, chicanery, and flimflam
   - in short, propaganda - emanating from the highest pulpits, podiums,
   and soapboxes in the land. Propaganda differs from mis/disinformation in
   that it need not be false, but instead, it relies on rhetorical devices
   which aim to manipulate the audience into a particular belief or
   behavior. While falsehoods can be debunked, albeit with disputable
   efficacy, beliefs are harder to cut through. The detection of ``Fake
   News{''} has received a lot of attention recently with some impressive
   results, however, propaganda detection remains challenging. This
   proposal aims to further the research into propaganda detection by
   constructing an ontology with this specific goal in mind, while drawing
   from multiple disciplines within Computer Science and the Social
   Sciences.}},

Abstract = {{Africa-based separatist groups have long deployed propaganda to woo the
   international community, seeking external support for their respective
   causes. In the digital age, they increasingly spread this propaganda
   over social media. Characterised by misinformation and disinformation,
   this propaganda has, in some cases, proven disruptive to the public
   diplomacy and nation building efforts of specific African countries. The
   propaganda has often triggered muscular - but not always efficacious -
   state responses. Using primary and secondary sources, this article
   investigates the online disinformation/misinformation campaigns of two
   separatist groups, namely the Ambazonia Defence Forces (of Cameroon) and
   the Indigenous People of Biafra (of Nigeria). Specifically, the article
   critically examines how the above mentioned separatist groups' use of
   online propaganda is a challenge to the official diplomacy of Cameroon
   and Nigeria, and explores the extent to which the online responses of
   these governments to this phenomenon have been effective.}},

Abstract = {{Digital media have changed the classical model of mass media that
   considers the transmitter of a message and a passive receiver, to a
   model where users of the digital media can appropriate the contents,
   recreate, and circulate them. In this context, online social media are a
   suitable circuit for the distribution of fake news and the spread of
   disinformation. Particularly, photo and video editing tools and recent
   advances in artificial intelligence allow non-professionals to easily
   counterfeit multimedia documents and create deep fakes. To avoid the
   spread of disinformation, some online social media deploy methods to
   filter fake content. Although this can be an effective method, its
   centralized approach gives an enormous power to the manager of these
   services. Considering the above, this paper outlines the main principles
   and research approach of the ongoing DISSIMILAR project, which is
   focused on the detection of fake news on social media platforms using
   information hiding techniques, in particular, digital watermarking,
   combined with machine learning approaches.}},

Volume = {{29}},

Abstract = {{Scholars, states and organisations have warned that authoritarian
   regimes and other hostile actors are projecting information to inflict
   harm upon others. Yet, there is little agreement on the nature of this
   threat. This is mirrored in the plethora of labels in use, ranging from
   ``disinformation{''} to ``sharp power{''} and ``information warfare{''}.
   In order to investigate this menace further, we turn our focus to
   ordinary people's anxieties, since a better understanding of threat
   perceptions will also provide a better understanding of the problem. We
   conducted a comprehensive case study comprising focus group discussions
   (n: 97) and an extensive survey (n: 2046) among Swedish citizens. We
   asked: To what extent do people worry about information influence and
   why? What can this tell us about the nature of this problem or threat?
   The empirical results suggest that respondents were first and foremost
   worried about societal cohesion and democracy. They also identified a
   risk that information influence can undermine trust in societal
   institutions and the EU. Based on our findings, we suggest that ``malign
   information influence{''} is an appropriate label to be used in future
   research. Finally, we propose directions for future systematic research
   on how malign information infuence is received and processed in
   different national contexts.}},

Journal = {{VISUAL COMMUNICATION}},

Volume = {{21}},

Abstract = {{This article analyses how pre-internet historical images of atrocity are
   used on social media in the era of misinformation, disinformation and a
   rising radical right. Combining scholarship in cultural sociology, media
   studies and communication, and history, the article introduces two
   concepts: image substitute and visual fake history. Image substitute is
   an image of an historical event from a particular time or place, which
   is used to represent a tragedy from a different decade or geographical
   location. Visual fake history is a combination of truth, misinformation
   and disinformation about past events through reliance on historical
   images as image substitutes and accompanying narratives. These concepts
   are developed empirically on the basis of images representing the
   Ukrainian famine of 1932-1933, circulated on Instagram under \#holodomor
   between 2012-2018. It is shown that the Ukrainian famine was visualized
   through images of Soviet and South Asian famines and the Holocaust,
   which were embedded in anti-communist and anti-Semitic narratives.}},

Abstract = {{Fact-checking has spread internationally, in part to confront the rise
   of digital disinformation campaigns. American studies suggests
   ideological asymmetry in attitudes toward fact-checking, as well as
   greater acceptance of the practice among those more interested in and
   knowledgeable about politics. We examine attitudes toward fact-checking
   across six European counties to put these findings in a broader context
   (N = 6,067). We find greater familiarity with and acceptance of
   fact-checking in Northern Europe (Sweden and Germany) than elsewhere
   (Italy, Spain, France, and Poland). We further find two dimensions of
   political antipathy: a left-right dimension and an ``anti-elite{''}
   dimension (including dissatisfaction with democracy and negative
   feelings toward the European Union), the latter of which more
   consistently predicts negative feelings toward fact-checkers in the
   countries examined. Our findings demonstrate that despite general
   acceptance of the movement, significant political divides remain. Those
   less likely to trust fact-checkers could be more vulnerable to
   disinformation targeting these divides, leading to a spiral of cynicism.}},

Abstract = {{This article studies ``fake news{''} beyond the consumption and
   dissemination of misinformation and disinformation. We uncover how the
   term ``fake news{''} serves as a discursive device for ordinary citizens
   to consolidate group identity in everyday political utterances on
   Twitter. Using computational linguistic and network analyses, we
   demonstrate that over the period of 2016-2018, there is an uptrend in
   the use of identity language in US Twitter users' discussions about
   ``fake news,{''} manifested by the increased frequency of group pronouns
   in combination with issues and sentiments that boost one's ingroup and
   derogate the outgroup. Furthermore, as opposed to the conventional
   wisdom that ``fake news{''} is a right-wing term, we uncover two
   disconnected retweet networks surrounding liberal and conservative
   opinion leaders. Like-minded individuals selectively amplify ingroup
   messages to claim the power to define falsehood and make group-serving
   blame attributions. We discuss the theoretical implications of our
   findings and offer new directions for future research on ``fake
   news,{''} misinformation, and disinformation.}},

Abstract = {{The new media ecology that has emerged after the death of the mass media
   era is characterized by complex communication flows and an exponential
   increase of producers. Nowadays, there is a permanent connectivity,
   mobile platforms are everywhere, and everybody shares information. There
   is a sense of information overdose, ideological polarization and people
   distrust the news media and politics. We can say that these were the
   right ingredients for a perfect disinformation storm. Hence, despite
   being a really old problem, fake news recently became a major concern in
   the internet era. Young people are at the core of this new context.
   After a widespread investment in Media and Information Literacy during
   the last decade, recent research has given signs that young people may
   not be prepared to deal with this kind of disinformation. In this study
   quantitative methods are used to analyze how 602 higher education
   students from Portugal perceive fake news and how they behave when
   interacting with false information. Our main findings show that these
   youngsters and young adults see themselves as proactive but have some
   misconceptions about fake news.}},

Abstract = {{Nowadays, multiple phenomena have promoted an impact on society,
   constituting in some cases, not only a contribution of benefits but also
   of risks. Among them, the fake news phenomenon is considered one of the
   most burning phenomena today due to the risk it poses to society. In
   view of this situation, the research community has carried out numerous
   studies that seek to address this issue from a multidisciplinary
   perspective. Based on this, the objective of this work was to analyze
   the productivity and, therefore, the impact of this topic in the
   research community. To this end, this work advocated a
   scientometric-type methodology, through scientometric laws, impact
   indicators, and scientific evolution of 640 publications of the web of
   science (WOS). The results showed the impact of the fake news discipline
   today, which is considered an emerging issue that is of interest to many
   knowledge disciplines around the world. Likewise, the results showed
   that the publications not only have a focus on analyzing the veracity or
   not of the news, but that it begins to vertebrate a new line of an
   investigation directed to the informational education and towards the
   prevention of the consumption of this type of news through the internet.}},

Abstract = {{``Fake news{''} is one of the major themes on public agenda in recent
   years, with a high potential for affecting social systems and democracy
   as a whole. Against this background, the increasingly use of fake
   content or alternative facts, coupled with the dynamics of social
   networks, has generated a special concern to understand and counteract
   this phenomenon. In the intelligence activity, the extent of the
   phenomenon and the magnitude of its consequences, amplified by the
   facilities provided by the social platforms, create significant
   difficulties in collecting and analyzing the information from open
   sources (OSINT), that obtained a considerable role in intelligence. In
   this context, this article aims to address the conceptual aspects and
   the implications of ``fake news{''} as a reference point in identifying

Title = {{Default to truth in information behavior: a proposed framework for
   understanding vulnerability to deceptive information}},
Journal = {{INFORMATION AND LEARNING SCIENCES}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - This study aims to recognize the challenge of identifying
   deceptive information and provides a framework for thinking about how we
   as humans negotiate the current media environment filled with
   misinformation and disinformation.
   Design/methodology/approach - This study reviews the influence of
   Wilson's (2016) General Theory of Information Behavior (IB) in the field
   of information science (IS) before introducing Levine's Truth-Default
   Theory (TDT) as a method of deception detection. By aligning Levine's
   findings with published scholarship on IB, this study illustrates the
   fundamental similarities between TDT and existing research in IS.
   Findings - This study introduces a modification of Wilson's work which
   incorporates truth-default, translating terms to apply this theory to
   the broader area of IB rather than Levine's original face-to-face
   deception detection.
   Originality/value - False information, particularly online, continues to
   be an increasing problem for both individuals and society, yet existing
   IB models cannot not amount for the necessary step of determining the
   truth or falsehood of consumed information. It is critical to integrate
   this crucial decision point in this study's IB models (e.g. Wilson's
   model) to acknowledge the human tendency to default to truth and thus
   providing a basis for studying the twin phenomena of misinformation and
   disinformation from an IS perspective. Moreover, this updated model for
   IB contributes the Truth Default Framework for studying how people
   approach the daunting task of determining truth, reliability and
   validity in the immense number of news items, social media posts and
   other sources of information they encounter daily. By understanding and

Abstract = {{Actors engaged in election disinformation are using online advertising
   platforms to spread political messages. In response to this threat,
   online advertising networks have started making political advertising on
   their platforms more transparent in order to enable third parties to
   detect malicious advertisers. We present a set of methodologies and
   perform a security analysis of Facebook's U.S. Ad Library, which is
   their political advertising transparency product. Unfortunately, we find
   that there are several weaknesses that enable a malicious advertiser to
   avoid accurate disclosure of their political ads. We also propose a
   clustering-based method to detect advertisers engaged in undeclared
   coordinated activity. Our clustering method identified 16 clusters of
   likely inauthentic communities that spent a total of over four million
   dollars on political advertising. This supports the idea that
   transparency could be a promising tool for combating disinformation.
   Finally, based on our findings, we make recommendations for improving
   the security of advertising transparency on Facebook and other
   platforms.}},

Abstract = {{This work aims to analyze how the character of the then presidential
   candidate Fernando Haddad is built in messages shared in groups of
   supporters of candidate Jair Bolsonaro in the WhatsApp instant messaging
   application, during the period from April 1, 2018 to December 31, 2018.
   Based on the assumptions of the Semiolinguistic theory (CHARAUDEAU,
   2010), we analyze the data collected through a tool called WhatsApp
   Monitor. The messages collected regard the construction of Fernando
   Haddad as an antagonist of Bolsonaro and are intended as media discourse
   and authentic newsletters, with the interest of causing certain effects
   on the reader, identified here as the potential voter. Thus, the results
   point to the emergence of a conflict between supposed left and right
   ideals. In this conflict, Jair Bolsonaro is constructed as the
   protagonist, through an image of a hero of the country. For which a
   speech of glorification is used, through the vision of pathos, trying to
   cause in the reader feelings of patriotism and hope. Fernando Haddad, in
   turn, is constructed as an antagonist, through the use of inciting aims,
   which try to convince the reader of certain information and, also, of
   the pathos aim which, unlike the previous use, is used to cause the
   feeling of repudiation.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we investigate dysfunctional information sharing on
   WhatsApp and Facebook, focusing on two explanatory variables-frequency
   of political talk and cross-cutting exposure-and potential remedies,
   such as witnessing, experiencing, and performing social corrections.
   Results suggest that dysfunctional sharing is pervasive, with nearly a
   quarter reporting sharing misinformation on Facebook and WhatsApp, but
   social corrections also occur relatively frequently. Platform matters,
   with corrections being more likely to be experienced or expressed on
   WhatsApp than Facebook. Taken together, our results suggest that the
   intimate nature of WhatsApp communication has important consequences for
   the dynamics of misinformation sharing, particularly with regard to
   facilitating social corrections.}},

Abstract = {{Social media has become a popular means for people to consume and share
   the news. At the same time, however, it has also enabled the wide
   dissemination of fake news, that is, news with intentionally false
   information, causing significant negative effects on society. To
   mitigate this problem, the research of fake news detection has recently
   received a lot of attention. Despite several existing computational
   solutions on the detection of fake news, the lack of comprehensive and
   community-driven fake news data sets has become one of major roadblocks.
   Not only existing data sets are scarce, they do not contain a myriad of
   features often required in the study such as news content, social
   context, and spatiotemporal information. Therefore, in this article, to
   facilitate fake news-related research, we present a fake news data
   repository FakeNewsNet, which contains two comprehensive data sets with
   diverse features in news content, social context, and spatiotemporal
   information. We present a comprehensive description of the FakeNewsNet,
   demonstrate an exploratory analysis of two data sets from different
   perspectives, and discuss the benefits of the FakeNewsNet for potential
   applications on fake news study on social media.}},

Journal = {{REVISTA DE SAUDE PUBLICA}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{42}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{512-516}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: To analyze the cultural meanings of infantile asthma from the
   perspective of the mother/carer of the child.
   METHODOLOGICAL PROCEDURES: Qualitative research conducted in 2004, in
   the city of Fortaleza (Northeastern Brazil). An ethnographic approach
   was utilized, consisting of participant observation and interviews with
   seven mothers, accompanying their children in a hospital emergency ward.
   Thematic analysis was the technique employed when identifying the
   meanings of mothers' discourse.
   ANALYSIS OF RESULTS: Two discussion categories were identified:
   ``disinformation on illness{''} in which it was possible to perceive
   that the mothers were not informed with respect to their children's
   illness; and ``cultural care{''} in which they relate information on
   caretaking and they use resources of popular knowledge to prevent their
   children's asthma, such as environmental care and the use of popular
   remedies, based on medicinal plants.
   CONCLUSIONS: The disinformation and lack of maternal knowledge on
   infantile asthma among the mothers indicate the need for an intense
   educational program, problematizing in nature and based on dialogue,
   conducted in close collaboration with the treatment aimed at improving
   the prognosis of the disease.}},

Journal = {{CHINESE JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION}},
Abstract = {{Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, the Taiwanese government has been able
   to retain legitimacy through prompt action and the use of multimedia to
   inform the public of prevention measures, quarantine rules, rationing of
   masks, and to build trust. First, the measures enacted by the Taiwanese
   government and its use of the media to address the impact of the
   pandemic were evaluated. Second, the study analyzed the communication
   strategies of the Taiwanese government to advise the public. The study
   also examined how an element of humor was also used to strengthen trust
   in the government and appeal to the citizens' solidarity and
   responsibility in the information campaign against misinformation
   regarding COVID-19. Subsequently, fake news, misinformation, and
   disinformation regarding COVID-19 in Taiwan were examined in terms of
   source, themes, evidence, and format. Much of the disinformation was
   traced to Chinese propaganda. The study analyzed the role of
   fact-checking organizations, which played a crucial role in building
   trust and establishing social consensus between scientists and the

   are practices that trace back to the early records of human history.
   Significant changes in the technological environment enabling ubiquity,

   misinformation in unforeseen ways, raising concerns around people's
   (mis)perception of social issues worldwide. As a wicked problem,
   limiting the harm caused by misinformation goes beyond technical
   solutions, requiring also regulatory and behavioural changes. This
   workshop proposes to unpack the challenge at hand by bringing together
   diverse perspectives to the problem. Based on participatory design
   principles, it will challenge participants to critically reflect the
   limits of existing socio-technical approaches and co-create scenarios in
   which digital platforms support misinformation resilience.}},

Abstract = {{After a few years focusing on issues such as electoral prediction
   through social media data, many analysts turned their attention toward
   fake news spreading and misinformation. A coherent next step in
   elections research through social media data would be identifying what
   makes communities and individuals less open to manipulation.
   Misinformation is not simply bad or false information but selective
   information circulated among isolated and unconnected groups. Here, I
   will discuss common cognitive biases in link sharing behavior and its
   effects on politically shaped communities in the Twitter public debate
   on the 2019 Spanish general election campaign. Finally, I will present
   and discuss some data-driven mechanisms that may contribute to the
   mitigation of mass manipulation.}},

Title = {{Delighting and Detesting Engagement: Emotional Politics of Junk News}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL MEDIA + SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{How do audiences make sense of and interact with political junk news on
   Facebook? How does the platform's ``emotional architecture{''} intervene
   in these sense-making, interactive processes? What kinds of mediated
   publics emerge on and through Facebook as a result? We study these
   questions through topic modeling 40,500 junk news articles,
   quantitatively analyzing their engagement metrics, and a qualitative
   comment analysis. This exploratory research design allows us to move
   between levels of public discourse, zooming in from cross-outlet talking
   points to microsociological processes of meaning-making, interaction,
   and emotional entrainment taking place within the comment boxes
   themselves. We propose the concepts of delighting and detesting
   engagement to illustrate how the interplay between audiences, platform
   architecture, and political junk news generates a bivalent emotional
   dynamic that routinely divides posts into highly ``loved{''} and highly
   ``angering.{''} We argue that high-performing (or in everyday parlance,
   viral) junk news bring otherwise disparate audience members together and
   orient their dramatic focus toward objects of collective joy, anger, or
   concern. In this context, the nature of political junk news is
   performative as they become resources for emotional signaling and the
   construction of group identity and shared feeling on social media. The
   emotions that animate junk news audiences typically refer back to a
   transpiring social relationship between two political sides. This
   affectively loaded ``us{''} versus ``them{''} dynamic is both enforced
   by Facebook's emotional architecture and made use of by junk news
   publishers.}},

Title = {{Scandalous Design: How Social Media Platforms' Responses to Scandal
   Impacts Campaigns and Elections}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL MEDIA + SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Given the role of social media in the modern election, scholars should
   not only study how platforms function for political actors; we should
   also study how platforms function as political actors. This essay
   therefore introduces the concept of scandalous design, which refers to
   programmatic changes in how social media operate in response to scandal.
   On the one hand, scandals can encourage changes in the architectural
   design of social media as products-that is, how platform providers
   introduce or manipulate features to mitigate the consequences of
   scandal. On the other, the concept of scandalous design recognizes the
   agency of these platforms as companies, who alter their organizational
   protocols in pursuit of furthering their business interests and
   generating goodwill with governments. The essay's main argument is that
   deconstructing platforms' responses to scandal can provide an empirical
   glimpse into how social media companies position themselves as political
   actors. I break down scandalous design into four typological groups: the
   introduction and manipulation of platform features, and changes to
   platforms' analog and digital protocols. The typology is buttressed by
   recent empirical examples from elections in the United States, European
   Union, India, Brazil, and China. Without cognizance of how platforms'
   operation- both digitally as products and politically as actors-evolves
   in response to scandal, scholars risk overlooking a key mechanism that
   contextualizes social media's role in contemporary elections.}},

Abstract = {{Deception is typically regarded as a morally impoverished choice.
   However, in the context of increasingly intimate, connected and ramified
   systems of online interaction, manipulating information in ways that
   could be considered deceptive is often necessary, useful, and even
   morally justifiable. In this study, we apply a speculative design
   approach to explore the idea of tools that assist in pro-social forms of
   online deception, such as those that conceal, distort, falsify and omit
   information in ways that promote sociality. In one-on-one
   semi-structured interviews, we asked 15 participants to respond to a
   selection of speculations, consisting of imagined tools that reify
   particular approaches to deception. Participants reflected upon
   potential practical, ethical, and social implications of the use of such
   tools, revealing a variety of ways such tools might one day encourage
   polite behaviour, support individual autonomy, provide a defence against
   privacy intrusions, navigate social status asymmetries, and even promote
   more open, honest behaviour.}},

Abstract = {{The salience of the debate over Russian political interference in the
   USA has increased significantly during the Trump administration.
   However, there is no consensus over how to respond to the interference
   of this openly illiberal power. This paper argues that we need to
   reconceptualize our understanding of Russian influence to understand
   this high level of contestation. While the current understanding of
   Russian influence is characterized as a problem of unwanted information
   flows, we argue that we also need to take seriously the ideological
   influence that the Russia regime has in the USA-that the appeal of the
   Russian regime's conservative and populist ideology can help to explain
   this division. By taking ideological attraction seriously, we can
   explain why it is currently difficult for the USA to respond to this
   threat and why solutions to Russian interference based on the
   information flow models need to be reconsidered.}},

Title = {{In-House Vs. Outsourced Trolls: How Digital Mercenaries Shape State
   Influence Strategies}},
Journal = {{POLITICAL COMMUNICATION}},
Abstract = {{When governments run influence operations they may leverage in-house
   capabilities, outsource to digital mercenaries, or use a combination of
   these strategies. We theorize that governments outsource because it
   provides plausible deniability if the operation is uncovered, and offers
   access to cutting-edge influence tactics beyond those common to
   established government institutions. Using data from Facebook, Twitter,
   and Instagram, we test implications of this theory via two covert online
   influence campaign case studies, each focused on Syria, executed by
   Russia's military intelligence agency (colloquially known as the GRU),
   and by the Internet Research Agency (IRA), a privately owned company. We
   find that the GRU focused on the creation of front media properties that
   produced longform journalistic content, an established tactic more
   amenable to reaching general audiences. By contrast, the IRA exploited
   the architecture of social media platforms to target specific audiences
   with memes and customized messages that were more narrowly tailored than
   those spread by the GRU. We also find that the tailored content produced
   by the IRA received higher engagement than GRU longform articles when
   posted to the same platforms, even if we include cascades of
   interactions from re-posts of GRU-authored articles that spread beyond
   their own Facebook page. Our findings highlight the importance of
   disaggregating information operations by actor type and across platforms
   to better understand their tactics and impact.}},

Journal = {{JOURNALISM}},
Abstract = {{Issue stances have always been an important factor in audiences' news
   processing, and this study found that audiences' attributions of motives
   to journalists can also affect news evaluations, particularly regarding
   whether a story is fake news. By exposing participants in Hong Kong to a
   news post (N = 215) via an online experiment, the findings suggest
   participants with opposing issue stances on the extradition bill
   controversy are likely to perceive the exact same new story as
   inaccurate and fake to significantly different degrees, consistent with
   the line of hostile media perceptions research. More notably, the
   phenomenon can be explained by the motives participants attribute to
   journalists. Among bill supporters, perceiving the journalists to be
   advocating mediates the relationship between perceived news inaccuracy
   and news fakeness; whereas perceiving journalists to be defending the
   authorities mediates the same relationship among bill opponents.
   Overall, the importance of motive attributions should not be ignored in

   Conclusions: Disinformation is a manipulation and filtering phenomenon
   based on ideological and emotional coincidence shared by those who
   circulate them. (Dis)information that converges with the users'
   interests, makes its dissemination indiscriminate, and facilitates its
   transnationality, with slight modifications, without affecting its
   acceptance and recirculation.}},

Abstract = {{This article demonstrates and critiques the coronavirus' cultural
   agency, which thanks to this human assistance, worked in synergy with
   its biological form. Looking at the virus as an `infodemic' and a set of
   transnational political events, it argues that a conjuncturally specific
   form of toxic, especially white, masculinity is key to understanding the
   virus's entwinement with contemporary post-truth or `emo-truth'
   politics. A conjunctural focus reveals why a certain form of aggressive
   (masculine and white), ruggedly individualist truth-telling, its false
   statements, its historical causes, and mortal effects could become so
   spectacularly impactful at a particular point in time, in particular
   places.}},

Abstract = {{Especially since the beginning of his third term as Russia's president
   in 2012, Vladimir Putin has pursued an increasingly hostile policy
   toward America and the West. In addition to overseeing Russian military
   interventions in Georgia, Ukraine, and Syria, Putin has overseen an
   enormous buildup in Russian nuclear and conventional forces. In
   addition, Putin has supported nationalist politicians and parties in the
   West that question or even oppose NATO and the EU in order to undermine
   Western cohesion. Putin's support for these nationalist forces may be
   less aimed at seeing them come to (or remain in) power than to disrupt
   and even discredit Western democracy. Further, Putin is pursuing these
   aims with a hybrid strategy short of war that relies on disinformation
   aimed at exploiting existing tensions (including ethnic and racial)
   within the West. Putin's hostility pose a serious challenge to America
   and the West, not least because the disinformation campaign in
   particular takes advantage of the freedom of expression that Western
   societies value so highly, and hence are loathe to curtail. This chapter
   discusses the nature of the challenge that Putin's Russia poses, and its
   implications for America and Canada in particular.}},

Abstract = {{This article describes the technological features of information warfare
   and possible lawful mechanisms to counter information attacks. The aim
   of the article is to analyse the political and legal features of
   information warfare. The tactics of the aggressor state's behaviour in a
   hybrid war was substantiated using the case of the information war
   between Russia and Ukraine. The channels of information dissemination,
   which are most often used for disintegration and disinformation
   purposes, were studied. Problematic issues of the domestic public space
   that most often appear in the perspective of disinformation attacks on
   the Internet are determined: the activities of the Armed Forces of
   Ukraine, cooperation between Ukraine and the EU, reforms in Ukrainian
   society, temporarily occupied territories and annexed Crimea, corruption
   in Ukraine. The tactics of confrontation between countries in the
   information space was analysed - attempts to establish their ``security
   belt{''} from other actors in international relations and to maintain
   their own dominant influence in certain regions by spreading
   misinformation. Promising areas of further research will be the analysis
   of the peculiarities of the national legal systems' development in order
   to counter misinformation in the context of the continuous development
   of democracy in the world.}},
